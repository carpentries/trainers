Meeting topics may be proposed by any member of the community. Meeting topics may be proposed via this repository (ideally) or by [email](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org). 
To submit a suggest a meeting topic here, please visit the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/discussions) and

In the text of your topic/comment, please include a request to discuss at a Trainer meeting. You may wish to specify whether you 
think a short discussion (during a standard meeting after pre/post workshop conversations) or a dedicated meeting would be more appropriate. 
  
Primary meetings are always held; "As Needed" meetings are held only if there is a scheduled topic for that day.
