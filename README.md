Meetings typically include pre- and post-training discussion and broader discussion on a specific topic.

In the text of your topic/comment, please include a request to discuss at a Trainer meeting. You may wish to specify whether you think a short discussion (during a standard meeting after pre/post workshop conversations) or a dedicated meeting would be more appropriate.
