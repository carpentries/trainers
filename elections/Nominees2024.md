#### Nathaniel Porter

I've been an instructor since 2020, trainer since 2021, and instructor training maintainer since 2022. I currently serve on the Trainer Leadership as secretary and as Maintainer Community Lead, and was co-chair of the Data Carpentry Social Science Curriculum Advisory Committee this year until stepping down to make room for maintainer leadership. Locally, I coordinate the Virginia Tech community of around 20 instructors, organizing around 10 workshops a year locally and teaching Software, Data, and Library Carpentry, in addition to a community of practice for our instructors. I'm currently working on designing new curriculum on open qualitative research, and have adapted Carpentries curriculum for a variety of other personal instructional needs.


#### Sanjay Fuloria 

30 workshops conducted


#### Jon Wheeler

I have been an instructor since 2019 and an instructor trainer since 2021. I am active in both roles, and try to teach an instructor training event each quarter.


#### Md Intekhabul Hafiz

Instructor since June 2021. Trainer since March 2022. Instructed and helped at a number of carpentries workshops in the US/Canada zone, Europe & Asia. Attended a number of community discussions and hosted teaching demos.

## If you have served on Trainers Leadership, use this space to share a few things about your past service in this role.


#### Annajiat Alim Rasel

I have attracted others to be trainers, instructors, helpers etc. Attended meetings and voiced opinions and provided feedbacks.

#### Nathaniel Porter

This has been my first year in trainers leadership, and our largest challenge was managing the updates to instructor training checkout criteria - both deciding on how to update the criteria and advising on implementation. As secretary, I also take and share meeting notes. I have also served informally as liaison to the instructor training maintainers, since I am on both. I've brought a number of challenging issues raised by contributors to the leadership group for consideration. Other activities have included screen new trainer applications and updating active trainer status renewal processes.


## What interests you about serving on the Trainers Leadership Committee?

#### Annajiat Alim Rasel

To improve diversity and representation, making training and trainers adjusted to low-resource settings.

#### Nathaniel Porter

I've been involved in many aspects of the Carpentries, but leading and supporting instructor training is the most rewarding role I've found. I want to help ensure the continued vitality of instructor training and the community of trainers, even as we manage major changes to leadership.

#### Sanjay Fuloria 

Public Service

#### Jon Wheeler

The laying off of full time Trainers leadership members affects us all, both individually and as a community. It's difficult to tell what the implications will be over the longer term, but I enjoy and value being an instructor and instructor trainer. Without knowing ahead of time what challenges we may face, I have several years' experience now with establishing and supporting a community of instructors in the state of New Mexico. I am interested in leveraging this experience in whatever way will most benefit the global trainer community.

#### Md Intekhabul Hafiz

I believe I can extend my skills to the needs of the committee and that I will be able to serve the number of hours in demand for the service. I also understand that this contribution is going to count towards retaining active status as a trainer.


## What would you bring to this role that may be valuable for the Committee and/or the community?


#### Annajiat Alim Rasel

Different perspectives, lobbying for continuous lifelong learning and more frequent upgradation trainings.

#### Nathaniel Porter

I bring experience in trainer leadership at a time when much is changing and most of the leadership is likely to turn over, as well as familiarity with a wide range of Carpentries roles and activities. My engagement as an instructor training maintainer is valuable to helping leadership in their role as curriculum advisors for instructor training. I also bring both instructional expertise, including research related to data pedagogy, and a variety of practical experience leading, designing, and coordinating workshops within and beyond the Carpentries. And past and current work with archives and open science nonprofits can provide insight into potential models to maintain and grow the size and effectiveness of our trainer community.

#### Sanjay Fuloria 

Experience

#### Jon Wheeler

The experience mentioned above of managing a statewide Carpentries initiative is of value. The University of New Mexico is the member institution, but we encourage and invite participation and contributions from other institutions throughout the state. This requires balancing individual and local capacity (and budgets!) for delivering technical workshops against demand. At a state level we have faced many of the capacity challenges that the Carpentries are facing at a national and global scale.

## Is there an issue that you are particularly motivated to enage with as a member of the Committee? Use this space to share what interests you about the issue.


#### Annajiat Alim Rasel

Trainer development and support systems

#### Nathaniel Porter

I want to help leadership support the continued vitality of trainer training, in light of the departure of core team members who have provided the major support for that initiative. Additionally, I am interested in continuing to explore additional models for delivering instructor training that can expand our capacity particularly to reach underserved groups and ensure we are able to meet the continually increasing demand for workshops.

#### Sanjay Fuloria

#### Jon Wheeler

Of the issues listed, I am very interested in and committed to designing and following through on support systems for Trainer community engagement. This seems to be a broad issue that includes and may partly address some of the other stated issues. But at this time there is also the broader question of how the Committee will work with the Carpentries leadership to maintain and potentially grow trainer engagement in the wake of recent changes. This is the issue that most motivates my interest in serving on the Committee.

## What are your strengths in collaborative work that will help you to be effective as a member of this group?


#### Annajiat Alim Rasel

Engaged with diverse set of teams in various capacities and bring in diverse experience

#### Nathaniel Porter

I work best in asynchronous collaboration - particularly with tasks that help move projects forward through leading from behind. That is, I lead through supporting, advising, and equipping others to succeed. Additionally, being part of a large and diverse local instructor community with regular meetings to support each other helps me be aware of a range of challenges and concerns with both instructor training and workshop-related needs.

#### Sanjay Fuloria

#### Jon Wheeler

I am an excellent listener, and in any collaboration I try to focus on maximizing the benefit for everyone involved in a process. I don't presume to know going into a project or process what the "maximum benefit" would be for any individual or group of participants, but I hope through active listening that I am able to contribute in ways that result in impactful outcomes for myself and others.

#### Md Intekhabul Hafiz

Professionally, I collaborate a lot of the work I'm involved in using git and several collaborative documents online as well as within institution. I have extensively participated in collaborative brainstorming, as well as management and facilitation of talent participation. I believe I am significantly competent in all of the above collaborative work I've participated in and that it will help being an effective member of this community as well."
