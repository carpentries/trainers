  - Will still tentatively be able to allow trainers to run self-organized sponsored events for underserved regions (but not open more)
- Curriculum maintenance oversight
  - Trainers Leadership is the Curriculum Advisory Committee for the Instructor Training Curriculum (Toby will be available to work with leadership re:CAC role)
  - [CAC Consultation Rubric](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/cac-consult-rubric.html)
  - Really, role is about being responsive when Maintainers need additional advice (per Toby)
  - In place of liaison role to CACs, Curriculum Team will provide templates for calling for new members etc.
  - Currently 4 maintainers (plus Karen) and no lead maintainer designated
  - Probably won’t be priority in recruitment unless leadership is reaching out for more
  - Survey about continuing service (Jan/Feb) followed by recruitment/assignment and onboarding in March

  - Recurring agenda item for topic review? - may be limited time for special topics

      - But would love to have leadership host some (maybe 1 per quarter)
