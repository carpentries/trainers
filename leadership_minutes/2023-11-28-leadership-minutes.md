Trainers Leadership 2023-11-28

Present- Mark, Pao, Trish, Nathaniel
Apologies - Karen
? - Annajiat

## Agenda

*Note on minutes: previous minutes available on [Git](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/tree/main/leadership_minutes) but there are no minutes for October because leadership did not meet as a full group and instead had a number of 1:1 meetings with Karen*

### Renewal discussion
Committee reviewed the committee survey form
- What is the purpose of recording active status?
  - Competency/currency of experience
  - Availability for training
  - Recognition of contribution
  - To encourage people to keep active in the training community.

- The forms help us understand what other activities people are doing, but if activities aren't related to training, they don't help with the purpose of the community.
- Take on case-by-case basis - sometimes other major projects take time away, but want to remain active and return as a trainer afterwards.
- Active - does the person want to remain engaged
- The goal of this project is to improve automation of status renewal, to minimise the forms that people have to fill in. Will always have to have case-by-case for some people. 
- As long as they are showing that they are engaging in some way in Trainer activities.
- What "counts" should depend on purpose intended for the renewal process - does it support the community and the goal of the process
- Should there be other status options as well as active and alumni?

- **What are acceptable alternative activities?**
    - For meetings: Other committees can replace meetings depending on the focus of that committee. e.g. curriculum - yes, CoC maybe not 
    - For trainings/demos: 
        - trainer leadership/board of directors service (for 1)
        - core team? - may not be worth monitoring externally
        - maintainers for instructor training? probably
        - carpentries (regional etc.) communities leaders? - probably not at least not regularly because very different
        - not much can replace leading a training
            - maybe could give shorter time to multiple trainings?


Current situation
* 3 non-responses
* 4 alumni requests (including 3 from core team)
* all others maintain current status

### Elections
* Change leadership election schedule and offer 2nd year without re-election for incumbents: https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/271
    * Is it necessary to change reelections?
    * We probably want to avoid the entire group turning over at once (for continuity and for Karen's sake)
    * but no one here is very concerned about the burden of applying/being reelected
    * **Conclusion: nomination and re-election will still be required for all leadership candidates (e.g. no change to policy)**
* other concerns about leadership elections (and numer of potential candidates)
    * it is likely this year that only one leadership member will continue (some term limited, others have other responsibilities)
    * Previous committee members can stand again after having one year off - limit is 3 *consecutive* years
    * Consider altering governance model to allow co-opting of non-elected members to bring in experience if required
* Original proposed schedule based on previous years
    * Nominations 4 Dec to 15 Jan
    * Trainer meetings 18 Jan
    * Elections 22 Jan to 4 Feb
* Current proposed schedule:
    * Nominations 4 (or 11) Dec to 29 Jan (*update: call for nominations was sent 2023-12-09*)
    * Trainer meetings 1 Feb
    * Elections 2 to 16 Feb
