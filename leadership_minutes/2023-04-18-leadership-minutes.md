## Notes
### Core Team Update
- Core Team Update
  - Checkout project implementation is on track for tentative rollout in mid-to-late June
    - Welcome sessions in place of community discussions
      - Working on plan to scale up the number of sessions
    - “Get involved” step in place of lesson contribution
    - Episode preparation (only) for demos (not a full lesson)
    - Will bring communications plans to May meeting
      - This will be a significant role for the Leadership Committee - make sure that all Trainers are on board and informed about changes
      - May want to update template for pre-training email to trainers (30 days) to call attention of the trainers to the change
      - May want to email trainees who have recently attended instructor training

### Leadership business
- Trainer status renewal process
  - Status renewal can serve many purposes. These include:
    - Supporting Trainer **preparedness** 
      - Events, demos, and meetings prepare Trainers to perform well and improve
    - Maintaining essential **capacity** 
      - Events and demos are essential services that we rely on Trainers to provide
    - Sustaining the Trainer **community**
      - Meetings and other communications create a welcoming environment and support preparedness of other Trainers. They build relationships that contribute to recruitment, retention, and performance. Attending meetings is both a benefit and a service.
    - Recognizing and valuing **contributions** 
      - Having standards assigns value and significance to contribution 
      - By having pathways for all, we continue to value all contributions even if they do not meet the standard. Communicating about this in a positive way is important (and hard).
  - Current documentation and process allows some (30-50%) to automatically renew, with remainder having to fill out form and/or schedule meetings
    - We do not reject trainers for inactivity but require active renewal by scheduling meeting
    - Alumni trainers can still reactivate later without much hassle
  - We hope to streamline process by
    - improving automation and tracking
    - reducing the number of people that end up filling out the form and/or meeting
      - This may involve more specifics on alternatives for automatic renewal and/or improved tracking of other service/activities
    - BUT changes to automation take time
  - Immediate goals for leadership (to be revisited next month):
    - Consider changes to automatic renewal criteria and/or equivalent service definitions
      - Will include reviewing service reported in August 2022 renewal process for items to include
    - Update form and documentation to reflect changes
      - Revised form may be able to use decision logic to reduce need for follow-up (Nathaniel volunteered to work on this)
  - Timeline for next renewal is TBD
    - Documentation states March; last year was August
- [PRs](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/pulls)
  - Only meeting minutes remaining
- [Proposal issues](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AProposal)
  - [Revising trainer community responsibilities](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/184)
    - Key considerations
      - Are there responsibilities that should apply to all trainers (including alumni and active)?
      - Are there situations besides CoC violations that should result in removal from trainer community (not just alumni status)?
        - If not, most expectations can still be treated as guidelines/aspirations
        - If so, the expectations may be used at some point to justify actions
    - Will revisit at future meeting
  - [Meeting schedule changes](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/245) are pending discussion at trainer meeting
  - Remaining issues (checkout changes and trainer meeting guide) on hold pending other processes
- No formal votes or decisions were made at this meeting
