## Notes
### Core Team Update
- Core Team Update
  - Potential issues with new checkout policies:
    - Choosing a single episode: it is now on trainees to select an appropriate episode (not Trainers).
    - Will recommend in the sign-up page that trainees avoid selecting an episode already nominated by someone else.
    - Need to update the [recommended episodes page](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demo_lessons.html) to make it more targetted to trainees, remove short (<5 min) episodes, and potentially re-introduce episodes with dependencies.
    - Include request to evaluate suitability of episodes for demos on Trainer end-of-demo feedback form.
  - Trainers active status renewal process
    - Discussion deferred to next meeting


### Leadership business
- [Proposal issues](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AProposal)
  - [Revising trainer community responsibilities](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/184)
    - All present "Liked" the proposal: proposal approved. The [Powers and Responsibilities](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/powers_responsibilities.md) document will be updated.
  - [Implementation of Checkout changes, 2023](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/251)
    - Proposal was discussed, the timeframe agreed to be feasible and the justification for backdating eligibility to apply for an extension to Jan 2022 agreed to be reasonable. 
    - All present "Liked" the proposal: proposal approved.
  - [Implementation of Trainer status renewal, 2023](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/252)
    - It was noted that the timeline in documentation says this should occur in March. With the Leadership Committee changing in February/March after annual elections, this is not practical.
    - It was recognised that the updated timeline will coincide with summer holiday season in parts of the world, and we will monitor to see if this is a barrier to returning activity reports.
    - All present "Liked" the proposal: proposal approved.

- The [six-monthly report to the Executive Council](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/reports/2023-04-report-to-ec.md) was reviewed by the Committee prior to sending to the EC. In future, the chair will aim to finalise the report before the new committee takes over so those involved in the activities can give input.
