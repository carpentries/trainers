# Trainer Leadership Committee Meeting 2023-09-19 23:00 UTC
Meeting rules: https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/policy/leader_meeting_rules.md

## Attendance
- Attending - Mark Crowe, Nathaniel Porter, Pao Corrales, Karen Word, Trisha Adamus, Annajiat Alim Rasel
- Apologies - 
- Absent - 

## Checkout changes
- Implemented 14 Aug, 2023
- Discussion of feedback from first month
  - Preliminary data from post-instructor training surveys shows more trainees experiencing confusion about checkout (36%) than prior to change (14%) (though much smaller sample)
  - Discussion that this may be partly due to trainers adjusting to the changes and/or needs for clarification/revision in lesson
  - Toby is going to move most of the lesson contribution instructions to the handbook. This should help make the Checkout page a little more manageable. It also is a better location since we encourage people to not just contribute for checkout.

## Trainers renewal - automation and process for this year
- Timeline
  - Week of 19 September automated emails will be sent to trainers who did not qualify for automatic renewal
  - 17 October leadership meeting review responses

## Open issues
- None

## Notes and ideas
- Awaiting proposal for alternate trainer meeting formats (such as shorter meetings or different meeting times) to make meetings more accessible
- Mark is standing down after 3 years, so chair position will be available
  - Suggestion to consider early preparation for handover if a current member volunteered

## Leadership elections
- Reviewed recent timelines for trainer leadership elections and relevant [documentation](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/governance.md)
- Discussion of how long people should have to think about running and when it's best to open/close nominations
- Agreed on tentative timelines for 2024:
  - Nominations open early December, close 29 January
  - Meet the candidate at 1 February (first February trainer meeting)
    - Suggestion made to include meet the candidates date in nomination solicitation and form, so people can hold the time
  - Elections open after 1 February trainer meetings
- Suggestion to allow current leadership members in their first year to extend term by 1 year without need to be re-elected
  - Goal to encourage continuity and reduce extra effort
  - No one has stood for reelection and not been elected so far
  - Questions about why do it for year 1-2 but not year 2-3 (there is a 3-year term limit)
  - This change would require ratification by vote of trainer community (so wouldn't take effect until 2025 at earliest)
  - Karen will submit a proposal for decision at October leadership meeting (decision would still require community approval)

## Trainer meetings
- Current proposal system (form to propose topics for trainer meetings) isn't really being used
- Karen is selecting topics that seem relevant
- Agreement that it's worth keeping system running if we try to remind people regularly to use it
  - Additionally, it's nice to put something in Git when an idea comes up, even if the suggester doesn't
- Upcoming topics
  - Week of 19 September - instructor training for people not seeking to become Carpentries instructors (Karen)
  - 19 October - Curriculum Updates (Nathaniel)

## Next meeting
17 October 2023 at 23:00 UTC
