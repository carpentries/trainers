### Leadership business
- To be actioned
  - Provide feedback on trainer status renewal form - complete (pending revised proposal)
- Proposals
  - [Evaluate potential changes to Trainer Meeting schedule](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/245)
    - **Decision to move the 2nd meeting 1 hour later** (3 Likes, 1 Can live with)
    - Encouraged Karen (or designee) to log in at regular time and post notice that meeting will start in 1 hour during first month
  - [Implementation of Checkout Changes](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/251) and [Recommended Changes to Instructor Training Checkout](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/226)
    - Still open but already approved (May meeting)
    - Largely actioned in other ways
    - Leaving open for now while remaining changes implemented (should be closed at launch, if not before)
  - [Implementation of Trainer Status Renewal](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/252)
    - Based on conversations between Karen and Infrastructure team, implementing a more automated system with AMY is likely achievable, although it could take up to a year (and definitely past planned summer renewal season)
      - Automated system would also allow individualized renewal timelines to reduce concentration of work/effort during one season
    - Leadership generally agreed it was worth exploring/pursing long-term automated solutions
    - Decision needs to be made soon about 2023 renewals
      - Potential options
        - Automatically renew everyone this time
        - Ask trainers to fill out form but renew everyone who responds
          - Purpose: gather more data on diversity of Carpentries-adjacent activities that may need to be considered for renewal
          - Downside: collects data (and asks time to input) without fully utilizing it
        - Follow last year's process
    - Leadership will discuss asynchronously in coming weeks after receiving more information
      - Goal of reaching consensus decision quickly to allow implementation timeline to proceed
