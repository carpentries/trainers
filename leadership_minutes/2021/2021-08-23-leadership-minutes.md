# Trainer Leadership Meeting 2021-08-23 23:00UTC

**Present**: K. Word, K. Barnes, A. Basu, A. Charbonneau, M. Crowe, J. Oliver
Regrets: S. Brown

1. Core Team update
    - communications project is coming along, will start drafting changes soon
    - curriculum updates are ongoing. Karen is working on formative assessment 
    sections. Still plan to survey the community before we merge the 
    curriculum. Will not be changed in the next week. 
3. Proposals
    - none
4. Discussion & Delegation
    - [IT attendance policy](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/123)
        - Amanda: it's important for people to go to the whole training. If it 
        weren't, we wouldn't have the training. In parallel, appreciate that 
        not everyone can take the full time to do things. Would it make any 
        sense for us to make it more modular, such that if you came to day 1 in 
        one workshop and day 2 in another, that would work better, vs making 
        them re-do the whole thing? Also vs having Karen meet with anyone who 
        needs to miss more than an hour, maybe we could track them by half 
        days, take attendance etc. Then have them make it up at another 
        workshop.How would this work for scheduling?
        - Mark: Scheduling is one thing; dropping someone in on morning 3 of a 
        4 day workshop, we have talked about having stable groups for certain 
        exercises etc. Otherwise agree. Making something inclusive doesn't mean 
        you don't have to do part of it. On the other hand, if you're going to 
        be an Instructor at some point you are going to have to commit to a big 
        block of time to instruct. So if someone is unable to set aside time 
        for [Instructor Training] IT, are they going to be a good choice as an 
        Instructor? Maybe not inclusive, but maybe a job requirement.
        - Arin: That raises why people are missing that time. If people knew in 
        advance that they have to set aside that time and some emergency arises 
        and they cannot attend, we have to be a little more accommodating, 
        understand that that was a contingency that couldn't be planned for. If 
        these people are habitual offenders it's a different proposition 
        altogether. Understand that if someone misses 1 hour or more they have 
        to do a makeup. In the past we have had people who could not attend for 
        part, we asked them to do another training session to make up with the 
        understanding that they are interchangeable. If you miss 1 hour or more 
        maybe you should on your own sign up for another training for that 
        particular session. Is that a good policy?
        - Mark: How often do we have this happen.
        - Kelly: Have had quite a few recently. When Karen was off, someone 
        missed one day of a 4 day workshop, Trainer said they could meet with 
        them, said that was OK. This is not being applied uniformly.
        - Karen: Requiring them to attend another workshop in its entirety is a 
        lot to ask (it occupies a whole seat), but joining in for part of a 
        workshop does require a whole seat.
        - Kelly: felt bad telling a learner they could miss part of a workshop, 
        then to tell them they have to re-take the entire workshop.
        - Mark: Reason asking how many, is whether there is an option to have a 
        dedicated catch-up workshop where people kind of come and go? 
        - Amanda: really like that idea, would totally teach an 
        everyone-changes-every-so-often class. Could also be a really good 
        once-every couple of months thing, for people who have just finished 
        and want to watch one, or people who want a refresher, etc.
        - Karen: But time zones...
        - Jeff: sounds cool, but overhead and logistics may be impractical. 
        Could be cool for onboarding new Trainers, too. Very similar thoughts 
        to what folks say elsewhere here -- if this is important to maintain 
        quality in Trainers, it's important. we wouldn't be volunteering if it 
        weren't. Someone is going to be unhappy if we change it or don't. How 
        do we minimize harm and maintain quality of IT? Our program requires IT 
        because it transforms the way you teach. This depends on our 
        requirements.
        - Amanda: mostly agree with Jeff. Leaving it the same... hadn't thought 
        of Mark's point before but it's true that being an Instructor requires 
        setting aside time. 
        - Arin: think of it like taking an exam. If you don't go to the second 
        part, you don't pass the exam. If the training itself works on a 
        continuum -- it's not piecemeal. Question about online training: a 
        person is absent without being physically absent. I can mute myself, 
        stop video, disappear. For all theoretical purposes I am present... am 
        I absent? What does absence mean? Absence from one session, we can live 
        with it. Absent from a critical aspect, it is a good idea to repeat the 
        entire 2 days. Won't harm anyone. How do you balance the economics?
        - Amanda: if someone feels that it is punitive to have to sit through 
        the training again they probably aren't going to like teaching because 
        it is very repetitive too
    - [Report to EC](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/89)
        - Mark: 1 page summary of actions, easy enough to divide up
        - Mark: looks like in total they want a summary from all of us 
        combined. One paragraph on the consultation exercise for Trainers 
        agreement. others could summarize the discussion on their proposals. 
        - Arin: start a document here or in GitHub, one pager needs to be in 
        some format
        - Amanda: could we add them as comments on this issue?
        - Karen: will remind everyone before next meeting to add summaries of 
        proposals in this issue!
5. Trainers agreement
    - [trainer agreememt](https://github.com/brownsarahm/handbook/blob/patch-2/topic_folders/instructor_training/duties_agreement.md)
    - [Karen's suggestions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PdLZhRU9ldwKsUMkUMkbsTC0jAxRJhs6Y1WSvrtBRKk/edit?usp=sharing) 
    re ~~Trainer Agreement~~ certification maintenance expectations
    - Mark: How many people have met the expectations this year? This should 
    influence how we set these expectations. 48 units was possibly based on 
    what?
    - Karen: 48 based on prior agreement (not based on math or data)
    - Arin: we want to grow the Trainer community. When we talk about people 
    not being an "active" Trainer, we want to find out people who do not want 
    to be engaged at all, vs people who simply aren't able to be as engaged. We 
    need to be a little careful about who we want to dissociate from the 
    community.These folks are one step above meta, training instructors, may 
    have different commitments in life. Have to be sensitive to these 
    commitments.
    - Mark: for every Trainer to teach this many workshops there simply aren't 
    enough in our time zone. 
    - Karen: Some trainers only want to work with their local community. There 
    are also people who do a lot of local organization who we haven't connected 
    with (yet). Need to start thinking about the tension between global efforts 
    and local organizing efforts. Scarcity of instructor training events in 
    some spots has led to increased participation in meetings to fulfill 
    expectations. Which is great, but we need more instructor training.
    - Arin: As Carpentries becomes more federated, there may be more people 
    involved in local communities; need a re-entry mechanism to re-engage 
    people
    - Mark: Even if itâ€™s federated, you have to have global engagement to keep 
    consistency across the organization 
    - Amanda: why do we have a Trainer Agreement, broadly? Is the thing that we 
    care about that people are up to date and doing stuff so that we are 
    confident in their skills? Or are we desperate to fill workshops and need 
    hours for people to participate?
    - Karen: Yes, these are two goals that are both important. It's difficult 
    to keep up with The Carpentries if you aren't involved. On the other hand, 
    as we grow, we continue to struggle to find Trainers for events. We cannot 
    teach more Instructors without Trainers. The Trainer community needs to 
    run. Maintaining the curriculum. Incentive helps these priorities compete 
    with all the other important things you have to do. We don't want to punish 
    people and we recognize that people can't teach often because of illness, 
    family demands, etc. 
    - Amanda: for people who only want to do stuff locally... I don't have any 
    interest in my local communities, but I only teach in my local time zone. 
    - Karen: Most members are now trained in pooled trainings. So even if you 
    want to teach for your local community, it will likely be a pooled event. 
    But what we mean is teaching pooled events. 
    - Jeff: I never teach locally because I think it's important to get 
    involved with the rest of the Carpentries community. This is how you get 
    connected with the other people who make up this community. 2 small 
    questions: is there an intent to rename this thing as the certification 
    maintenance?
    - Amanda will find/redo PR that she made and lost
    - Amanda: maybe we need time, and general Carpentries stuff?
    - Karen: Kelly and Karen will deliver report on what Trainers *have been* 
    doing in the past year before next meeting to aid discussion of what they 
    *should be* doing in the next year(s)
