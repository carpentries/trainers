## Examples of fundamental beliefs impacting inclusivity
- Background
  - Occasioned by [pull request](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/pull/1557) to remove age of earth as example of fundamental belief error
  - Discussed at trainer meetings ([notes](https://pad.carpentries.org/trainers#L111))
    - Karen's summary of meeting feedback: 
      - Most statements reflected agreement that the existing example is appropriate
      - Some were uncertain whether it was necessary to take a stand on this particular example
      - There was interest in impact-free alternative examples. Geocentrism was proposed on 2 occasions as a historical example that lacks modern support.
      - There was some discussion about the possibility of creating a callout that anticipates objections to any example, identifying scientific ways of knowing as a frame of reference applied to identifying beliefs as “misconceptions”.
- Notes
  - Mark: trainer notes could include examples more relevant to specific cultures (e.g. capital example relevant to own region, not US)
  - There was some discussion of who has authority here (maintainers, trainers leadership, other?) but leadership acts like a Curriculum Advisory Committee for Instructor Training so has oversight
  - Mark and Pao expressed concern about "compromise" and consistency of changing anything and recommended preserving the example and proposing some additional language in the lesson to call attention (either instructor note or callout) to:
    - examples of this kind of error will always risk offending someone because they address deep-rooted beliefs
    - our examples focus on scientifically accepted facts because the Carpentries is research and science-oriented
- Decisions
  - Karen made a [proposal](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/260) incorporating preferred options of not changing example but adding language, which leaders approved (see below)
  - Nathaniel (as secretary) will communicate regarding the decision in a comment on the original PR before closing it
  - Nathaniel will open an issue to write the callout text or explanation
