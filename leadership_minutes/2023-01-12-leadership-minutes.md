Meeting rules: https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/policy/leader_meeting_rules.md

Attending: Pao, Sarah, Jeff, Karen
Apologies:
Absent: Mark, Bonny

1. Karen's list of things related to the Election
    - **Recruiting Trainers to self-nominate for Leadership**
        - Only have one nomination as of 2023-01-12 
        - Pao: Are we going to extend the deadline?
        - Karen: Not planning to, given other dates (e.g. Trainers meeting and 
        elections), although powers & responsibilities document does afford 
        some latitude
    - [Suggested changes to Powers and Responsibilities](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/pull/230/files)
    - [Suggested changes to Certification Renewal](https://github.com/karenword/handbook/pull/1/files)
        - Action item: Karen will revise both PRs, submit as issues in GitHub 
        repo and request review from Leadership. Hopefully tomorrow. Submit 
        draft PR to handbook.
    - [Spreadsheet tracking these and other to-do's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LRa0zL32jk8OE2HfsmMrxAljokZJE_rINt-hKRFUn9Y/edit?usp=sharing)
        - should all of these be issues?
2. Updates & questions re checkout project implementation
    - 4 projects: core implementation, demos scheduling, technical solutions to 
    tracking trainee progress, and cohorts
    - Core implementation will come first but has some dependencies, e.g. 
    welcome sessions
        - in theory some pieces could be implemented sooner, like relaxing demo 
        rules, but this would spread out the communication effort and 
        potentially confuse people
        - welcome sessions need consideration given the need for scaling; will 
        involve Community Development Team
        - We need to work with the Workbench beta schedule to make updates that 
        don't break things
    - Will need to consider how to handle retroactive applications
        - people currently within 90 day limit for checkout
        - people over 90 day limit but within 1 year
        - anyone ever e.g. people who completed all steps except lesson 
        contribution
        - Sarah: when our program changes degree requirements, anyone admitted 
        under old rules can follow those, but can choose to switch to the new 
        ones. 
        - Pao: same here but we have a deadline. Can't have 2 systems 
        concurrently
        - We can take edge casess on a case by case basis but don't seek them 
        out
