1. Core team updates
    - reminder to give feedback on [lesson program policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_qdKvmn9zIBI7spdB-55atCkui13l-NClRl8YbuszNQ/edit?usp=sharing)
    before tomorrow
        - the same document we looked at before, but updated. We are not a
        lesson program so the policies aren't a perfect fit, but are meant to
        be mostly applicable.
        - Sarah: What is going to fit us correctly if we aren't a lesson
        program?
        - Karen: I think we will be treated as a lesson program mostly and then
        committee rules
        - Sarah: I'd like to know which rules we are following when
    - Trainer Training selection process
        - 16 accepted (usual cap 14)
        - Future goal: specify cutoff below which applicants for reserved seats
        through membership will not be accepted.
        - An interesting, heterogenous group. More globally diverse. A number
        of reserved seats through membership.
        - What do we do if we have to say no to a membership applicant? We need
        clearer guidelines on how.
        - Overall subjective score takes the midpoint and suggests anything
        under that may mean they could cause harm. The other parts of the
        rubric don't have a harm component.
        - Sarah: Re: not wanting to accept someone from a membership slot.
        Could we have a revise option?
        - Amanda: Is the goal not to have to tell them no?
        - Karen: The goal is to protect our program. But we don't have a
        threshold set between approve and not approve. I want to be sure we say
        no if we need to say no.
        - Mark: What do we do if they are clearly not meeting the minimum
        qualification? Good correlation between rubric and subjective.
        - Karen: Inter-rater reliability seemed better this time.
        - Sarah: if one person is always scoring a certain way, is it worth
        talking to them? That person may also be able to give input on what
        instructions would help.
        - Mark: Is it necessary that the subjective is aligned with the rubric?
        Could we add them?
        - Karen: If we add them, we have to make sure the weighting is correct
        - Jeff: Is there anything in the sheet about whether they are yes or
        no?
        - Karen: I can add that back in.
        - Mark: Could you give people a ranking after the training and line it
        up against the scores?
        - Amanda: Post results could be helpful to see which application
        questions are predictive.
        - Karen will bring this back in the new year.
    - Karen often has more than updates, e.g. requests for support on
    decision-making. Should GitHub proposals workflow be used for things like
    this? When do action items require a formal vote?
    - Sarah: I think we should compare things to the roles and
        responsibilities document. If it is core team responsibility, don't
        need a proposal. Things that are the leadership or Trainer community at
        large should be proposals. If that is insufficient for us to make
        decisions, we need to revise that document.
        - Karen: If I'm not doing it right, can you tell me?
        - Sarah: If it is on the agenda, and becomes a proposal, we can approve
        it asynchronously.
        - Karen: I want to make sure that I don't leave a meeting thinking that
        I have a consensus if we haven't voted.
        - Sarah: Proposals and asynchronously approval could be a good way to
        always make sure that we have an official vote
        - Jeff: Proposals and asynchronously approval lend a good sense of
        transparency
2. Elections for Trainers Leadership
     - Deadline - January 18
3. In progress proposals
     - curriculum maintenance
     - checkout
     - update to renewals process/timeline
         - Needs to be approved [Issue 143](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/143)
         - Karen: When we talk about elections, we can talk about this. The
         goal is to combine the votes. We don't need to hash it out again.
         - Mark: The four things in the list, is it (A and B and C) or D?
         - Karen: It's (A and B and C) or D
         - Everyone likes it. It is approved, with the addition of the "ands" per the previous clarification. 
4. Outstanding goals
