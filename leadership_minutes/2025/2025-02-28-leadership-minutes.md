### Agenda and notes

1.  Core team update
    1.  Working on Q2 ITT Calendar
        1.  Great results this time: Around 55 respondents. Still a good number that didn't respond but enough signed up that there will be about 10 ITT during Q2.
    2.  Cleaning up Active Instructor Trainers Roster
        1.  Review of trainer activity indicates that there is a group of trainers who have not been active over the past few years and haven't completed the poll. Core Team will review and set to inactive status.
        2.  Will follow up with trainers who are active but didn't respond to the form. Remind to say no - that's fine - but expectation is to fill out the form.
        3.  Past quarter 2 trainings were canceled due to low registrations. So we're good on the trainer side but are looking at trainee numbers. Few workshops anymore reach max registrations.
    3. Opt-Out Email list
	    1. Core Team has implemented an opt out email. Once a trainer has been certified, they are now automatically added to email list. Welcome email will include instructions for how to opt out, and info will be provided during the welcome session. Looking at where to add to instructor notes for instructor training.

		    2. Does this summary adequately describe the Committee's current agenda?
			    1. In the coming year, this panel will address many issues. These include but are not limited to: continuing development of the certification renewal process, designing support systems for Trainer community engagement, and advising The Carpentries Core Team on policy and support structures.
		    3. Does the Core Team have a login for election buddy? With Maneesha?

	4. Maintainers update

		2. Need to recruit around 25 maintainers this year overall.
