### Agenda and notes

1.  Core team update
2.  Current activities
	1. [Trainers meeting guide](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/pull/310): Still not done!
		1. Anyone in TLC can have a look and accept revisions for merging the PR.
			1. Some new content/info needs to be added re second monthly meeting default (send email when cancelling or when using?) and emailing the list (timing of communication).
	2. TLC elections:
		1. Sher will add nomination form and info to the newsletter
		2. Currently one nominee - we need to add a name field to the form.
			1. Need to push on Slack and Trainer's List (Topic Box).
		3. What do we need to do between closing of nominations and the next trainers' meeting?
			1.  At close of nominations liz collates list and shares with trainer community (list and email) also confirms meeting 3/4 April with candidates in an email.
		4. TLC should start contacting people directly to encourage nominations.
	3. Topic of the month for next trainers' meeting - meet the TLC candidates
		1. If candidates can't attend, ask them to do a recording? Something to share with trainers. Or a write-up.
			1. Recording a video could be a big ask. Could create barriers to participating.
			2.  What has been done in the past - some recollection that candidates have added answers to questions in the etherpad when they couldn't make meetings.
	4. Recommendations for what to cut from instructor training
		1. We created a table/doc.
		2. Need for a link or other pointer to this document.
	5. Discussion of other topics of interest to community or standing/lingering issues.
		1. Concept maps - Concept maps are a perennial difficulty for trainees. Any thoughts about how to make this more attainable? What has been tried before? I personally find them extremely valuable and wish I knew of a way to make them easier for people to learn about and use.
			1. With many new trainers, this could be a good topic to revisit.
		2. Resources in the instructor training GitHub repository for suggesting topics for trainer meetings.
3.  Proposals and pull requests
4.  Additional business
	1. Redaction check (standing item).
	2. Confirm the next back up meeting.
5.  Action items (with responsible person and timeline)
6.  Next meeting: [April 11, 01:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Carpentries+Teaching+Demo&iso=20250411T0100)
