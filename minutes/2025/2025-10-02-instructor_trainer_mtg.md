    Topic of the month: Feedback – How do we provide feedback to fellow trainers? What do you really do with feedback from a workshop or training?

    Making an issue or pull request on the instructor training lesson: https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/

    Instructor training often teaching with people that you do not know well and tiredness. It can be difficult when you are not co-teaching with the same people to build relationship and strategies.

    Contrast with technical workshops where you can build routines for feedback.

    Trying to keep notes of past things that have worked well or poorly. Becomes easier if you are teaching often.

    Keeping a mental list of feedback.

    Difficulty of providing feedback on the whole training.

    Process for giving feedback between trainers is informal. Sarah S helped created a form that asked for specific feedback. 

    Could it be opt in? Could we have an observer to provide focused feedback?

    Use of transcription on zoom as a tool for providing feedback.

    Trying to avoid more forms at least as a first option.

    In instructor training there is space for informal conversions during breakout room times.

    Multiple options for opportunities to think about feedback: before the training, during, after

    What about opportunities for instructors to observe a training with someone who is known to teach a section well?

    Could we use trainer meetings as a place to demo an episode?

    Integrate this into trainer training as a test case.

    Can be easier with 3 trainers to have opportunity to have dedicated feedback person.

    How do you feel currently with receiving/giving feedback? Should there be more? 

    We should do as we teach. We should have more formal ways of feedback. Informal things are happening. We can promote the process of giving and recieving feedback more for our learners with more experience within our trainer community. 

    Having to give more feedback will make it easier to provide feedback to co-trainers. 

    What would more formal feedback look like? Having an observer? 

    Asking people if they would like feedback, then provide a form and make an extra person available to record it and have the discussion with?

    Task force to develop a pilot program for giving feedback and observing? Perhaps trialing it with new trainers as part of the next round of trainer training?

    Have a specific time or episode to observe.

    not a large time investment when its a single episode

    spend more time on the "feedback" section during the training. How to give feedback could be beneficial? 

    already full, maybe demo it so that they can see an example of giving/receiving feedback

    Could trainers do a live demo and feedback instead of watching the videos for feedback?

    Needs to be a part of the curriculum.

    Maybe the instructor provides feedback for the video first. Think of Greg as your best friend and wants feedback to get better.

    Or one of the trainers does a demo and the other trainer provides feedback.

    Trying to get trainees to write feedback that you would actually say to another person.

    Topic of the month: Feedback – How do we provide feedback to fellow trainers? What do you really do with feedback from a workshop or training?

    get together after the session (immediately) go through the minute cards. Use that feedback as the discussion. sometimes someone does a summary of the feedback and review it from the day before. 

    haven't given feedback after the training besides it was a delight working with you

    don't keep a consious note of something to do specifically 

    watching peoples teaching tactics and adopting if something they like

    take the feedback and address it the next day. 

    difficult to give feedback bc it may be a different from the way I teach but not wrong

    find it difficult to give feedback bc its not done often 

    reflecting with the learners from the previous feedback. 

    using the minute cards is nice because it is timely and allows you to have something to discuss right away. 

    use the 2x2 matrix to give feedback to cotrainer if time allows. Use the postive to state how I can adapt my training style

    Feedback from learners that was directed towards a specific trainer? 

    yes, cultural distinction which can be difficult to resolve. Depends on background (humanities vs. sciences)

    Feel you received enough feedback to adapt and develop teaching skill? 

    as a new Trainer, used it mostly for watching/observing 

    there was good enough information. could have used information to fill in gaps. used 1 up/down

    Are we practicing what we teach? 

    learning the lessons every time we teach and activiely watching as we teach with others

    after teaching so long cummulative effect 

    good to try to participate in the 1 up/down as a trainer

    learn more that allows it to pour into other areas of our lives (professional/personal)

    What works well, what we could do differently as a community? 

    1 up/down is the best part of the training. giving everyone permission to provide feedback. to receive it and not respond is intimidating/liberating 

    would like to have something more formal to give feedback to each other 

    taking the ownership to ask "what I can do better" and ask for specific feedback

    2x2 matrix for feedback is a good idea for providing feedback to each other - a good template when we are trying to think of things we can say
