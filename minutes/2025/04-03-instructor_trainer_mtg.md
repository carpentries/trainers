Agenda:

    Introductions

    name/pronouns, location, affiliations, animal we admire the most

    Pre/post discussion

    Jon: 9 signups, thanks to Erin for stepping in at the last minute; mostly a quiet bunch

    What do we do when no one picks an episode ahead of time?

    Idea - Instructors choose something for learners; probably a stock suggestion for anyone

    No exercises in the inclusion section; maybe we should have some there?

    The core value exercise at the beginning is one of the best things we offer in the workshop.


    Jeff: Taught with May and Hao; 11 learners

    What do you cut? "Lesson study" is a suggestion. Wall of text.

    Idea - Second vote for moving some text out of that section. It does set up feedback section well, so don't chop it all

    Topic of the month

    Meet the TLC candidates: https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/elections/Nominees2025.md


    Question: Re-engagement of inactive/alumni Trainers

    Jon: People's career choices may be part of this. Is post-pandemic timing an issue for some people with anxiety/burnout?

    Amanda: Does anything hold you back? Is there a focus group idea?

    Question: How do your own/institutional goals align with being on committee? 

    Amanda: I teach a lot of entry-level courses, but I want to be more "tech-y".

    Jon: Starting a sabbatical soon, and this is a key part of the service activity I want to build out further. Got their Dean to support a state-level project as a member, and this promotes broader engagement for the university and the state.

    Question: What additions or followups to the Instructor Training curriculum should we have?

    Jon: We orient this to Carpentries workshops using Carpentries methods, so this is tough to answer. What are the outside things we could bring in? What are the ways that people use this curriculum in other contexts? Example: Concept Maps.

    Amanda: Local context may be different from others; a stronger local in-person community may be able to offer more expansions as part of other professional development.

    Question: Number of candidates?

    Jon: Currently have 3 total. What can we do in established practice for full group (five)

    Liz: Spaces are kept open during vacancies, and could be a recommendation for this group

    Amanda: We should nudge trainers to run!

Training discussion (pre and post):

    Mike Trizna, Smithsonian Institution (pre)

    Sue McClatchy, The Jackson Laboratory (post)

    how to use the new schedule

    handbook was great. one of the email templates weren't up to date

    had someone shadow and gave input

    May Chan (post; March 10-13)

    Camera on/off - about 40% had camera off

    screensharing vs. referring to an image in the etherpad

    like etherpad bc keeps engage, prefer sharing screeen bc of one screen

    Community Roles

    Amanda talked about telling people at the outset that they need to pick a five minute lesson demo, but if they did not pick one, that they would assign them the Unix shell lesson; this worked well when people didn't seem to be able to pick something.

    Meet the TLC candidates: https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/elections/Nominees2025.md

    What are your plans to engage with the inactive Instructor Trainers? 

    How would you adapt the monthly Instructor Trainers Meeting, if any? 


Idea: spotlight on one of the sections of the instructor training curriculum. Do a deep dive to  help the maintainers resolve open issues, etc.
