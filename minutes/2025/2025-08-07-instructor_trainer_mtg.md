Training discussion (pre and post):

    Samantha (post)

    Samantha: When trainees read the materials beforehand, they didn't like going over the Carpentries and the Carpentries way of doing things in the training

    Sher: The Core Team is looking at potentially separating out the pedagogy from the Carpentries in Instructor Training, since not everyone takes the training to become a Carpentries instructor but are in it to learn about teaching

    Toby: The How the Carpentries Works episode can feel a bit rote, I've tried to get at the motivation of why the Carpentries operates as it does to make it more interesting and to help trainees understand the community

    Scott: A lot of our trainees wanted to learn more about teaching and to put something on their CV, not necessarily thinking about the organization, but the community is so important and helpful, I haven't really thought of them as separate but others might

    Cera: This might be akin to an expert awareness gap (how we tink of the trainingâ€”very Carpentries focused and so trainees can join the community of certified instructors vs. how some trainees think of it)

    Dimitrios: My trainees had pedagogy questions that weren't relevant to Carpentries workshops or wouldn't work well in that context, but were more relevant to university teaching

    Samantha: When I tried to get them back on topic, they may have felt we were forcing Carpentries things

    Cera: Suggest they read How Learning Works if they want more information about pedagogy

    Samantha: The book used to be in Instructor Training

    Cera and Ben (pre)

    Ben: We are planning to be intentional about what we cut and take notes, curious about how it goes and what trends appear

    Cera: This helps the ITLC in producing their what-to-cut guide, I'm curious how it will feel to teach with this in the back of my mind

    If we kept it exactly to time, that would be strange and we might wonder what went wrong!

Agenda:

    Introductions/Icebreaker

    Icebreaker: What is your favorite type of plant and why?

    Pre/post discussion

    Samantha: Some negative feedback on recent training that they didn't like that the training was focused so much on Carpentries and how we do things in the Carpentries/Carpentries Way of Doing

    Sher: We recognize that there are people going through instructor training because they simply just want the pedagogy; we're looking at separating that out in the future, recognizing that there are people who are going through Instructor training for two different paths

    Toby: the "how we operate" section can feel like just a checklist; talking more about motivation for why it works the way it does can help perhaps

    Scott: It may not actually be all that unexpected, we've often promoted Carpentries as a way to learn some pedagogy

    Dimitrios: also teaching in this, it was hard to find a way to keep them focused on Carpentries teaching instead of pedagogy in general 

    pre discussion - Ben & Cera - gonna keep tabs on what we end up cutting 

    Announcements

    Q4 ITT Scheduling: Next week you will receive an email to provide your availibity to teach ITT and host teaching demos during Q4. The form will remain open until Friday, August 22. Please remember to complete the form, even if you are not available to teach. Note: this is one of the requirements for maintaing your active status. 

    Thank you for your feedback during last month's special topic regarding AI and the Instructor Training Curriculum. Please read the latest post: https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/08/genai-curriculum-discussions/

    There's another AI-focused community session next Tuesday August 12: https://pad.carpentries.org/community-sessions-2025


    Topic of the month: Incentives or recognitions that Instructor Trainers would like to see to keep engagement and motivation high.

    Samantha: Badges

    Sue, Annajiat: Certificates

    Learners at workshops like certificates, too

    Annajiat: Blog posts, Carpentries reportings

    Cera: My Trainer certificate is meaningful to me

    Toby: Letter of recommendation

    Sher: Travel to workshops

    Scott: Teaching workshops, contributing lessons looks good at my workplace; participating in discussions on AI benefits my professional work so I can justify attending, my employers understanding the Carpentries is a respectable organization and that the time I spend with them is valuable

    Kari: Have been talking with a grant provider about building a grant proposal with one sentence about incentivizing our volunteer work, their point is that we shouldn't incentivize because what we do is good for science and good for the public

    They felt very strongly about this sentence

    Donating time is a privilege

    Cera: Volunteering only will tend to exclude people we don't want to exclude because volunteering is costly

    Sue: There need to be some incentives for volunteers/ways to give back, a badge is a simple motivator and nice recognition

    Sue: What is the value of a badge or certificate? It comes down to who issued it

    The Carpentries is internationally recognized so that is valuable

    Danielle: It's more of a thank you or gratitude or appreciation than an incentive

    Toby: Not badging might make sense because people believe in what they're doing, but people put time into this including as professional development for job applications and tenure and this is evidence that at least some people's involvement is at least partially professionally motivated

    Samantha: For some people they may need to show the value to their employer - can help it become part of work time allocation helping to reduce privilege of having spare time outside of work

    Sher: From the business perspective, we rely heavily on our volunteers, and we need to ensure they are enjoying their experience and want to continue to give their time

    Sometimes I feel like I'm doing a lot for organizations without getting paid and feel like, what do I have to show for this?

    Can be frustrating to do so much work without incentive

    It's important to tangibly show our appreciation and let volunteers know they truly are the reason for the Carpentries existence

    Cera: Volunteer work is intrinsically motivating and we also appreciate tangible representations of our work

    Cera: listening to all of you makes me want to put together of video of all of you saying what you get out of volunteering with the Carpentries. Soaring music behind it, b-roll stock footage of people typing and pointing at a screen together

    Toby: I remember a great conversation about a similar idea, at CarpentryConnect Manchester 2019. In our imagined version of that video, the people typing and pointing at the screen were being helped by somebody dressed in a rubber duck costume.

    Sue: Perhaps precariousness of some job positions motivates wanting incentives; important context to think about

    Scott: I haven't felt pressure from the Carpentries or community to contribute more, it's probably common for someone's involvement to go in waves, I've always felt appreciated

    Cera: 'Many hands make light work' which is why growth and retention of volunteers is so important; if there's enough of us then it's fine when people need to step back.

    Topic of the month: Incentives or recognitions that Instructor Trainers would like to see to keep engagement and motivation high.

    Sara: Badge (LinkedIn)

    CSCCE: Professional badging (https://www.cscce.org/)

    May have a link with the Carpentries already, great system!

    Erin: It's its own reward

    Jeff: Are there hinderances that could be removed to increase involvement?

    Time

    Having three people train rather than two helped lighten the load, everyone had a day off

    Sher: We're talking about this actively!

    Sara: makes a difference and have a contigency. there is still a backup should anything happen. Also great for new trainers to have 2 people to watch and provide a rich expereince. 

    Erin: Thought that 3 was the norm. 

    Amanda: first experience teaching there were 3 and there were a lot of technical difficulties. Couldn't imagine what it would have been like if there were only 2. 

    Sara: timezone is always a factor that is hard to control. 

    Jeff: Challenge that has to face is how to support the global community and recognize things are happening at different times. 2 meetings and that may not apply to everyone and it is outside working hours. Maybe 3 meeting approach

    Difficult from a capacity standpoint, teams are small and members may be in time zones that make it difficult to reconcile

    Amanda: is the Trainer for her organisation. Concern that having to teach 2 Trainings for your institution to maintain discount. It is hard to find time. Maybe having 3 Trainers would help alleviate that. 

    Erin: Removing git for checkout was good. 

    Sara: CAC has a donut (opt-int) everytwo weeks and create private chats and meet with different people in the slack channel. Great for creating human connections. Personal connection would help to incentivize the Trainer community. Its a bot and would show that it is random. https://www.donut.com/pricing/

    not much of a social aspect and don't get to meet with others.
