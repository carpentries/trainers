Agenda:

    Introductions

    name (pronouns) / location / affiliation / Can you tell us about a book/TV show/movie/podcast that changed how you thought about things? Or is generally amazing and you can't help but recommend it!

    Pre/post discussion

    Jon - 4 half day workshop - last minute fill in - teaching with Amanda and Tim.

    increasing demand for breaks

    got some feedback on the references to AMY: It's not explicit to learners that they're using AMY when they prepare for instructor training. Can we approach it differently? Not a lot of time in the lesson to go into it in detail

    Sher - generally I try to get people into AMY before they start training. You can always let them know that going over AMY will happen in the welcome session.

    I don't see AMY referenced in the welcome email to learners (although it is in the Checkout page that's linked). Is there another email to learners where AMY is referenced?

    Janetta - In my skill up session for creating the workshop website I devote some time to connecting AMY for new instructors.

    Jon - also the blog about self organised workshops came out just after we talked about it, so that was helpful

    Jeff - upcoming workshop with May and Hao

    when we send out the info - how do we reference the science of teaching reading? Has anyone else thought about how to weave it into oes anyone address this

    Likely that many/most do not read it

    Could be useful to connect the reading to the training at a high level

    Some have asked about it - if we're asking people to do things in advance, it should be required. Bring it up as part of the introduction.

    Announcements

    Liz will act as returning officer

    Become a Maintainer for Instructor Trainer Training! (Nathaniel) 

    Maintaining the Instructor Training is a big job. We get quite a few issues and pull requests sent from new instructors, trainers, and others. We are thankful for the work of all of our IT maintainers and especially recognize those who are stepping down this year. We will be looking to onboard at least 1 additional certified trainer as a maintainer for Instructor Training this Spring (late March). If you're passionate about supporting new instructors, this is a great chance to contribute. We'll be recruiting maintainers for other lessons soon, but if you are interested in maintaining Instructor Training, please contact Maintainer Community Lead (and IT maintainer) Nathaniel Porter.

    Reminder that one of the requirements for maintaining Active Status is that you must complete the quarterly poll for each time it is sent out (4x). Please take the time to complete it, even if you are not able to teach for that quarter. 

    Sher will send out a nudge soon to remind trainers to fill out the form if they haven't already.

    Suggestion that a personal email can be more visible than TopicBox. Ability to do that may be dependent on capacity.

    Changes to self organized workshops - https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/02/changes-to-self-organised-workshops/


    Topic of the month

    How does your community teach Carpentries workshops? Do you do SOWs? COWs? What do your mix and match workshops look like?

    Scott: At UC, a large community of instructors - we can help each other out, tend to do self organized. Have a large event at the beginning of the year, cover lots of topics/lessons. Chance to work together and support each other. I participated in more centrally organized workshops during COVID. Good opportunity to experience new ways to teach and put on workshops as difrerent instructors than the ones you teach with the most can bring different outlooks to teaching.

    Jannetta: We do self organized. Several roles. Mostly do Software Carpentry - split topics across 3 days, with one day for each. Can organize a couple of workshops a month. Other instructors interested in the opportunity serve as co-instructors or helpers. Offer certificate for completion of all topics. 

    UAz - Mostly Software and Library Carpentry. Self-organized. 

    Paula: Smithsonian, try to do some hyrbid mini-workshops to better accommodate people's schedules. Feedback is that it's hard to come to a 4 day workshop. Library Carpentry is popular. Also try to do two Data Carpentry, alternating Python and R.

    Jannetta: People aren't always able to come for two full days, which is why we started splitting it up. A one day workshop works well. Might introduce Library Carpentry lessons in the 1 day format as well.

    What do instructor trainees come looking forward to teach?

    Jordan: Self organized or Carpentries "inspired" workshops.

    Scott: Sometimes get people who are helpers and become instructors. More comfortable organizing self-organized workshops because they know the people. Could be a challenge with centrally organized, the idea of working with people we're not as familiar with.

    (Purpose of this discussion is an opportunity for Trainers to ask questions about the new definitions of SOWs and COWs. Also to increase the 'wide bridges' across trainer community of what type of workshops are more popular where.)

    Danielle: Most of the purpose of the update was to make it more clear what a self-organized workshop is. There wasn't a readily available definition before, so the intent was to make things more clear.

    Discussion of length - is a full two days expected or required for a self-organized workshop?

    Teaching any episodes from any Carpentry curriculum can count. Doesn't have to be a set amount of time spent.

    Pre/post discussion

    9 participants (very interactive) over 2 full days

    First day is information heavy

    Second day is more active, more down time for the trainers

    Is there a link/discussion about how the first day is so full of information?

    Nathaniel and SherAaron will search for notes about this

    Another group said they preferred the information-heavy Day 1 compared to Day 2!

    Maybe the 4 half-days lends itself better to this because the information is spread out?

    Feedback varies by group

    Ideas differ by group of trainers

    It's important to cover the information about teaching and learning first before they practice

    Can post about this in the Trainer Slack to get discussion

    Day 1 also is repeating the same kind of exercise over and over (i.e., write in the Etherpad), but we don't have much time to look in the Etherpad and review learner's responses 

    Can we add different types of formative assessment in Day 1 to change things up?

    For 4-day, needed to add extra breaks (which people really appreciated)

    The 4-day training has more flexiblity to add breaks

    We will not remind everyone individually - watch for those emails!

    Calendar is now published through June

    If you aren't sure if you filled it out, Slack SherAaron - the form also sends a confirmation after you fill it out, so I realized you can just search for it in your email, ie "Instructor Training Schedule 2025 Q2"

    Changes to self organized workshops - https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/02/changes-to-self-organised-workshops/

    Two big changes

    New fee for teaching Genomics and using AWS instance

    How to report self-organized and mix-and-match workshops

    Go to the handbook and blog post for details

    Question from Hao: for mix-and-match workshops that use lessons from different Carpentries streams, is there guidance on naming? (e.g. 2 lessons from Data Carpentry, 2 lessons from Software Carpentry)

    This needs to be considered

    Maybe name it based on the audience

    Maybe name it for the content

    Not everyone knows what SWC/DC/LC means

    Not a right or wrong answer for naming

    Could be "Carpentries Workshop" without a specific lesson

    Next meeting is 3/4 April - meet the TLC candidates!


    Topic of the month

    How does your community teach Carpentries workshops? Do you do SOWs? COWs? What do your mix and match workshops look like?

    Changed from 2-day workshops to more modular format where learners can sign up a day of one type of work (e.g., Python, R, bash, Git, spreadsheet)

    Flexibility: Sign up for what is most needed

    Less duplication of teaching

    But we get less people doing bash and Git

    Harder to report because these become mix-and-match

    Lots of Carpentries Incubator workshops

    We report these: https://carpentries-incubator.org/#:~:text=Next-,Workshops,-Upcoming%20Workshops%20teaching

    There is a link to report these: https://carpentries-incubato r.org/#:~:text=Next-,Workshops,-Upcoming%20Workshops%20teaching

    We do a lot of 4 half-day SOWs as well as mini-workshops

    We split up the Python and R daylong workshops into multiple shorter sessions

    What do instructor trainees come looking forward to teach?

    (Purpose of this discussion is an opportunity for Trainers to ask questions about the new definitions of SOWs and COWs. Also to increase the 'wide bridges' across trainer community of what type of workshops are more popular where.)

    Core Team meeting - we want to make Incubator lessons easier to use, so we need to know about your experiences with them - please share your experiences, thoughts, etc.!

    We mainly teach the Incubator lessons we're developing ourselves

    There is consideration of combining the mix-and-match and Incubator workshop forms

    The list of Incubator lessons is dauntingly large
