    Can miss up to 4 hours. If they miss more than that, they can retake or makeup time with Sher.

    The trainers do not need to hound the trainees to make sure they make it up. The onus is on the trainee.

    Sher: Usefulness of the attendance spreadsheet and putting in notes to give some context.

    Jake: What to do when behavior of a trainee raises some concerns about their fit as an instructor. For example, speaking over people. Not code of conduct.

    Scott: Using feedback when teaching as a way to guide people.

    Timothy: Seconds feedback.

    Sher: Working towards getting feedback from workshops. Could do feedback from instructor trainer.

    Jesse: What do you do with the feedback if there is someone who has a bad vibe.

    Scott: Growing as a teacher.

    Jake: Importance of feedback and creating opportunities for feedback to enable people to grow.

    Check ins with new instructors

    Danielle: Importance of timely feedback, something within 24 hours.

    Jannetta: Having a pre- and post-workshop meeting with team as times to give feedback. Notes that they are difficult to organize. Others note the significance of debriefs.

    Schedule time in calendar before and after workshop.

    Sarah provided a template for post-workshop meeting: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nuB_NH23VfgkqIhUMHbbaeFSLUpPnT18mcNZ4IhITIU/edit?tab=t.0

Agenda:

    Introductions/Icebreaker

    Icebreaker: When do you pack for travel? Early or the last minute?

    Pre/post discussion

    Tips for small groups?

    Relax and enjoy it!

    Encourage video on

    More exercises and breakout rooms, give learners more time to interact

    Be mindful of group and individual dynamics and interaction styles

    Easier to take more time, spend time - take advantage and do all the exercises

    Erin, Giorgia, Liz - first class taught

    Well prepared, spent a lot of time beforehand to prep; having access to the content helped

    Small group but still skipped stuff

    How do we integrate the "7 principles of learning (Science of Learning)" pre-reading more into the instruction?

    Preparing for your training section: https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/instructor/index.html#preparing-for-your-training

    Reading PDF: https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf

    Difficulty of reading that as a trainer in addition to other prep.

    We also don't know if the learners have read it.

    How to better integrate the tools - Google, Zoom, slides, etc. in a seamless way?

    Feedback that said it was hard to follow along with the Google Doc and the discussion

    Can share the Google Doc/etherpad, but got conflicting feedback on that.

    One tactic is to keep it on Zoom to emphasize discussion.

    Can't see results of the post-workshop survey - is this because of the group size (yes, see announcement below)? Minute card feedback was positive

    Graphs in survey results will show, but not qualitative feedback

    Nobody had questions after the training - not about Carpentries or anything, and we were asking them to voice and also share questions anonymously.

    Topic of the month: Managing borderline cases: instructor training and teaching demos

    Attendance policy: https://docs.carpentries.org/handbooks/instructors.html#partial-absence

    Participants are able to miss up to 4 hours without having to retake the training

    Consider the sections the learners miss - maybe something they can talk to the instructors about over breaks, but refer to Sher (instructor.training@) when that is not possible

    Some trainers reach out, some do not. Trainers are not obligated to do that - the onus is on the trainee to reach out. But trainers can reach out if they want and are comfortable doing so.

    Helpful for Sher when we leave notes in the attendance sheet about partial or incomplete attendance. 

    It matters what the trainees miss, especially the teaching practice session.

    How to communicate with learners who reach out beforehand that they may miss something?

    Most people will let you know. Can also keep up with attendance by monitoring Zoom.

    Can refer learners to the sections they will likely miss, offer opportunity to follow up and discuss.

    Good to be mindful of time zones. It may be super early or late and that is why people miss time.

    How to deal with giving feedback to trainees that you get a bad vibe from (not code of conduct violations)?

    How do you provide feedback to co-instructors after a workshop or training?

    Take advantage of the structured feedback to emphasize that they should choose what they want feeback on, then they may be more receptive to feedback.

    Boarderline cases on passing someone

    Would you want them to teach a workshop in front of a bunch of people, being mindful of why someone might struggle?
