    Message from Executive Director, Kari Jordan:

    PyCon (https://us.pycon.org/2025/)  US is coming up, and I’m honored to share that I’ll be giving the closing keynote! As part of my talk, I’d love to highlight members of our community who are using Python in meaningful ways. 

    Are you working on a project, tool, or research that uses Python?

    What problem are you tackling, and how is Python helping you solve it?

    Tell us your story (https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/nkRxLsri)  — I’d be thrilled to feature your work during the keynote!

    Additionally, if you're attending PyCon US, I hope you'll stop by The Carpentries booth, and participate in our duck hunt. You'll find details soon on Mastodon (https://hachyderm.io/@thecarpentries)  and Bluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/carpentries.carpentries.org). Tell us your story and let us know if you're coming to PyCon US

    Maneesha will be sending emails regarding scheduling ITT for Q3 soon. Remember that all Instructor Trainers are required to respond to the form. Even if you will not be able to train during the quarter

    Topic of the month

    LLM and generative AI: What impacts do we anticipate with regard to instructor training?

    Blog posts by AI tag: https://carpentries.org/blog/tag/artificial-intelligence/

    Recap from meeting 1: Trainers interested in a blurb recognizing that AI can be helpful, but still need to have some expertise in order to assess and use code output by AI. In the Carpentries we have terms/concepts for developing these skills. Recognize the need for some context in training.

    Added an additional section on AI to a data carpentry workshop. We received feedback from it seperately, but it was also really well received. - Talked about the imporatnce of being to output the code, what struck me was workflow based. Not just asking for code, but asking AI to develop an analytic workflow.

    Haven't encountered anything yet, but one thing is where learners are at in their stage or learning. In areas we know well, we can see what is wrong in an AI response. Novices can't see the errors if they don't have the experience. Can we connect to mental models? For example the diagram about connections and models - is there a way to incorporate AI into this, in terms of ability to critically assess AI outputs based on expertise?

    Sometimes using AI to solve a problem can result in getting more stuck, go down rabbit holes. Asking the wrong question - AI is going to respond no matter what, and we need to know whether our question was correct in the first place. How you think about the problem in the first place makes a difference. Is this the right question?

    Should I ask AI for a solution rather than blur things with a lot of ideas? There are many tools we use non-expertly all the time. So using AI this way is not a new problem, but a compounded problem. There are topics/lessons we don't teach also because we aren't able to assess the materials based on knowledge. But there is a lot of stuff in the lesson material that can help learners ask the right questions. LLM provides shortcuts, but outputs should be tested. Hard to adapt, but adapt we will. Talking and typing might still be the right thing to do, but exercises and how they follow along may change. Maybe we spend more time debugging rather than building the algorithm.

    Earlier meeting someone mentioned how helpful AI can be to intermediate or expert learners. Can be more of a distraction for learners. 

    Content experience is one thing, but developing a mental model is about learning how to learn. As part of how we teach instructors to think about learning, we encounter ways to leverage AI or show an approach that fits in with what we are doing.

    A lot of this has me thinking about a colleague of mine who is a great R instructor. He's more confident teaching R than using R in his work. Lately he's started using chatgpt in writing code, and in the past couple weeks his confidence level has really taken off. We talk about metacognition in ITT, to the point where we know where we can critically use AI. It's an opportunity to talk more about metacognition with learners in ITT. How do we build a metacognitive exercise into a challenge that might provide users to test their confidence to assess the quality of the code that they're getting.  It fluctuates too - realising which are the 'wrong questions' happens too.

    Metacognition relates to the idea around the need for Carpentries, for computation thinking. That is the fundamental skill. Recent article, https://cacm.acm.org/blogcacm/computational-thinking-the-idea-that-lived/. Aligns with a recent Carpentries blog post https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/10/announcing-intro-computational-thinking/. Is there a place for trainers to consider some form of computational thinking together with metacognition as a foundational concept/application?

    Shared video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xS68sl2D70. Lots of relevant reading, watching to do. Back to the question - what would a metacognitive exercise look like? Where would it fit in our practice as trainers?

    What is the next step for us - as trainers? What can we do to support the instructors? We should have a statement. 

    I think it's important to use ai tools for workflows rather than to solve discreet problems. This is mor technicla though - because a workshop is a workflow, has anyone tried taking the exercises (which are stand alone) can we plug these  into ai and compare to that sense of how to interprete the results that you get from an AI tool (since we are the experts in this instance). Especially in these computational environments there's no one right way - could both be reinfocing, and also elaborative.

    Re not knowing what the right question is sometimes - if people were able t share their prompts, compare and contrast. Here's the problem we're trying to solve, prompt AI and see what you get. Separate idea: One way trainers can use AI - save time by summarizing episodes or sections that don't need as much time as others. Would it make sense to get a summary from an AI. Humans can do this when we're familiar with a concept, harder for novices.

    Have seen exercises with comparing prompts and outputs to prompts. It can help develop expertise and understanding.

    Power of community - like the Carpentries - to help develop comfort, awareness with tools like AI. 

    A statement from the trainer community would be useful for the instructor community. What is more useful for the trainer community? To feel prepared for how we relate to and talk about AI within the ITT? Would someone be willing to work on this? (TLC?) Also, what about a mini workshop to talk about AI as it relates to Carpentries and instructor training? Or have a look at Toby's PR and comment? https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-gapminder/pull/695

    Community has varied thoughts/ideas/feelings about this, so crafting a statement may be difficult.

    Right - greater importance is creating resources for helping trainers address AI in trainings. 

    Suggestion that trainer community ask TLC to develop a mini workshop in a community meeting re developing mental models around AI?

Agenda:

    Introductions

    name/pronouns, location, affiliations, animal we admire the most

    Pre/post discussion

    Jon: 9 signups, thanks to Erin for stepping in at the last minute; mostly a quiet bunch

    What do we do when no one picks an episode ahead of time?

    Idea - Instructors choose something for learners; probably a stock suggestion for anyone

    No exercises in the inclusion section; maybe we should have some there?

    The core value exercise at the beginning is one of the best things we offer in the workshop.


    Jeff: Taught with May and Hao; 11 learners

    What do you cut? "Lesson study" is a suggestion. Wall of text.

    Idea - Second vote for moving some text out of that section. It does set up feedback section well, so don't chop it all

    Topic of the month

    Meet the TLC candidates: https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/elections/Nominees2025.md


    Question: Re-engagement of inactive/alumni Trainers

    Jon: People's career choices may be part of this. Is post-pandemic timing an issue for some people with anxiety/burnout?

    Amanda: Does anything hold you back? Is there a focus group idea?

    Question: How do your own/institutional goals align with being on committee? 

    Amanda: I teach a lot of entry-level courses, but I want to be more "tech-y".

    Jon: Starting a sabbatical soon, and this is a key part of the service activity I want to build out further. Got their Dean to support a state-level project as a member, and this promotes broader engagement for the university and the state.

    Question: What additions or followups to the Instructor Training curriculum should we have?

    Jon: We orient this to Carpentries workshops using Carpentries methods, so this is tough to answer. What are the outside things we could bring in? What are the ways that people use this curriculum in other contexts? Example: Concept Maps.

    Amanda: Local context may be different from others; a stronger local in-person community may be able to offer more expansions as part of other professional development.

    Question: Number of candidates?

    Jon: Currently have 3 total. What can we do in established practice for full group (five)

    Liz: Spaces are kept open during vacancies, and could be a recommendation for this group

    Amanda: We should nudge trainers to run!
