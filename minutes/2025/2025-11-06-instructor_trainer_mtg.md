    Pre/post discussion

    Idea to have a trainer meeting that is an etherpad template review sprint. Match up template and instructor training materials.

    Overview of AMY: Discussed in welcome session. Showing AMY during training.

    Issue created based on the AMY discussion, please add your thoughts - https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/issues/1927

    Sher is working on some materials for templates for trainings.

    Here is the Carpentries instructor training slide template I used: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bNRMElQuh-R99hFDdldZoCLoplcCK7ox1zVYQv3eeTk/edit?usp=sharing

    Announcements

    Update from Leadership committee on feedback for trainers:

    ITLC discussed using the instructor notes to provide some guides, prompts, or tips to encourage feedback between trainers during trainings (when learners are in breakout rooms) and at the end of a training. Next step is working on issue and PR on instructor training.

    Updating Accessibility Language in Instructor Training Curriclum (Angelique Trusler)

    The term “accommodations” can translate differently across regions (i.e accommodation = hotel room). To promote clarity and inclusivity, CET decided to change all references from “accommodations” to “accessibility support” (adding that it is also refered to as accomodations) +1

    The Carpentries has Published the 5 year Strategic Plan report (2020-2025)

    Take a moment to see all the community accomplished and what's ahead!

    Topic of the month: Carpentries is looking to expand our Instructor Training to external partners who are interested in the teaching pedagogy but do not necessarily want to become certified instructors. This will result in a change in the structure to instructor training: day 1 will concentrate on pedagogy and day 2 will concentrate on Carpentries specifc curriculum. We want to hear what questions you may have and answer any questions to help us with implementation.

    (Hao) - this could help with some instructor training sessions where people are interested in the pedagogy but not nec. Carpentries instructor certification - I would be worried about some folks dropping out from the Carpentries curriculum component and leaving a smaller number for those episodes / discussions / etc.

    Nathaniel: avoiding multiple versions of the curriculum material. 

    Importance of practice teaching that is in day 2.

    Practice, feedback, improvement loop is valuable beyond participatory coding.

    Difficult to  to separate the sauce from live demonstration (doesn’t have to be coding; some of our lessons don’t code anyway). That’s really a core part of the philosophy, not just the method.

    Scott: learner feedback having an emphasis on learning more about teaching and not necessarily to be a certified intstructor. Had interest in teaching coding. The group also was excited about formative feedback and live coding and working together. According to the prework survey, half said they want to teach Carpentries workshops and a third that they wanted to learn more about the Carpentries. A third said they wanted to improve their teaching. 

    Sarah: Could offer the live coding as an optional addition for people who have taken this training  (or anyone one who wants it)?

    Maybe a shorter extra session

    What are the organizations looking for in something like this?

    From my experience with university programs, I found the one-off TA training mostly useless; but the ~10 session active learning Teaching program that required interaction and bringing your own examples was very effective.

    Developing learner profiles who may not be as oriented towards participatory coding.

    Scott: Community is an important part of the Carpenries. Importance of the different steps to becoming an instructor and being a part of the community.

    These steps are also important parts of learning/practicing the pedagogy.

    Nathaniel: Ideally, even if we’re organizing trainings for organizations that don’t want to be part of the core Carpentries community, we would also still have some ways planned to integrate and provide a degree of community at least optionally for those folks (maybe at a minimum some slack channels that are targeted to “non-core” instructors etc)

    Pre/post discussion

    Sher: Training in October. Biggest feedback received was more breaktime. 5 minutes between each section, in addition to the 15 minute breaks. Jeff has a Google Doc for planning, Sher is getting it ready and available to share. Helpful for training and prepping. 

    Was it challenging to build that extra break time into the schedule? Not in general. Stayed on time, the group wasn't as talkative as sometimes so there was flexibility.

    Updating Accessibility Language in Instructor Training Curriclum (SherAaron Hurt)

    Topic of the month: Carpentries is looking to expand our Instructor Training to external partners who are interested in the teaching pedagogy but do not necessarily want to become certified instructors. This will result in a change in the structure to instructor training: day 1 will concentrate on pedagogy and day 2 will concentrate on Carpentries specifc curriculum. We want to hear what questions you may have and answer any questions to help us with implementation.

    Canadian Bioinformatics Hub - has a membership for the purposes of training internal instructors. Don't know how much value community will place on being a Carpentries instructor. Taught a recent training, many participants were involved with both instruction and running the CBH program and found the Carpentries practices instructive and useful re things like checkout, administration (i.e. "how does a different organization do this?"). 

    Curious to know what is the target audience for people who would be taking the training for the pedagogy only. Do similar pedagogical trainings exist in other places? Is the Carpentries filling a gap? Instructor training compares favorably with other trainings, would like to see more people take it. What is the use case?

    Recall that a few months ago the Carpentries rescinded an offer from the NSF, not trying to diversify offerings and not depend as much on grants. So, what types of a la carte services can we offer? Have heard from many orgs that they are interested in the pedagogy but not the hands-on aspects. Also, ~50% of people who take training don't complete checkout, so there is evidence of interest and demand. Allows us to expand into other communities to bring in additional revenue without changing what we do. As trainers, want us to be able to teach the same thing.

    Is the idea to offer this as a general pedagogy training? Will it still be specific to people wanting to teach programming or skills related to data analysis?

    There are people who are interested in learning the pedagogy to become better teachers, not just computational and data skills teaching.

    If the live coding is going to be on day 2, that is still very important. Hard to see how feedback will be incorporated into the first day pedagogical practices.

    Core Team recognizes the value of the feedback and practice opportunities. Thinking and working with TLC to make sure these opportunities exist in day 1.

    Live coding portion tends to be a lightbulb moment for instructors that also helps them learn non-coding-specific points such as slowing down and fully explaining things to limit extraneous cognitive load. Would be great to pass some of the live coding sections through to the non-Carpentries-specific section.

    A “live teaching” section could be a more generalized form of live coding that would teach many of the same concepts

    One of the key feedback items from last training event was that students didn't get enough pedagogy. Much of this is in the trainer curriculum but doesn't make it into the TTT, so could be a good idea to combine and work more trainer training concepts into instructor training. Could need to be integrated to provide a fuller view of the pedagogy.

    Would the non-Carpentries specific training be more open? Could more people apply? There are people who are interested in developing teaching skills and pedagogy but not interested in teaching Carpentries style or computational workshops.

    Can't say just yet. Could be a membership benefit or purchsed a la carte.

    Potential audience could be researchers going out to develop infrastructure. Looking at how colleagues were teaching IT staff about a specific tool, feedback related to a need for Carpentries pedagogy in upskilling people training others in systems, tools, etc. Staff who work in research infrastructure and train university IT staff are part of a layer of the system that seem to miss these opportunities - possible audience for this training

    Any timeline or general plan on when or how to implement?

    Would like to have it in place by Q1 of 2026.

    Re the split between the pedagogy and the practice/Carpentries specific things (etherpad, minute cards). These build on the theoretical pedagogy, would like to see a pedgogical focus also emphasize these types of practices that implement the theory as examples of teaching by this philosophy. These are important and shouldn't be taken out as too Carpentries specific.

    Trainers would need to include and discuss examples and strategies, and that would likely result in reference to Carpentries practices like feedback, minute cards, etc. 

    Definitely don't want trainers to feel that they can't lean into or include Carpentries workshop examples, but this could also be an opportunity to introduce other types of experiences. Don't want trainers to feel unqualified to teach just because learners may be from other sectors.

    Can imagine that we could get something out for Q1, but highlighting something on the TTT lesson maintenance Slack - when was the last time that we did a deep dive into the literature on pedagogy? Could be a nice hackathon to get people together to make sure what we're teaching is up to date with the current literature. Maybe a later version of this material.

    For example, there are 8 principles in latest version of How Learning Works instead of 7. 

    Above question is relevant and timely - timeline for Q1 is to try it as a pilot. Will continue to adjust. As we go through it and see areas where we can adapt, we will.

    Question re feeback announcement. Idea of giving time for trainers to give feedback to other trainers also applies to technical workshops. Often gets a lot of positive feedback, but not as much constructive feedback. Often want to share feedback, but the time and opportunity are not built in. It would be worth having time for that built into workshops.

    Core Team is developing a survey for workshop hosts and instructors to fill out, so that will be one way to provide feedback to each other and also to the Core Team.

    People do try to create space to meet, but not always comfortable with providing constructive feedback on the spot. So the survey could be an opportunity for that in writing.

    In a previous 4 day training, after all the learners had left we provided minute card style feedback to each other. It was valuable and worked well, and we did give both positive and constructive feedback. That may have been helped by doing minute cards, too, as feedback from learners that could be built upon.
