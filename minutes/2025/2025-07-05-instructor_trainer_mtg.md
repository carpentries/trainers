Notetaker: Amanda

Agenda:

    Introductions

    Icebreaker: Fresh water activities (lakes and rivers) or salt water activities (oceans and seas)?

    Pre/post discussion

    Maneesha: taught in early June. Small training with 4 ppl becuase of last minute cancellations and no show

    Different sort of experience to teach such a small group, less interactions possible than with a large group

    Put in a lot of issues and pull requests (PRs) when going over Instructor Training curriculum carefully because I hadn't taught it in a while

    Nathaniel: We love issues and PRs!

    Sher: We could put a reminder about making issues and PRs in Maneesha's emails

    Jesse: This can be a good way to remind yourself about issues you find whle teaching training

    Question: How carefully are you all following the curriculum? Do other people see these issues (typos, broken links)? Do they know they can or should do anything about this by submitting issues and PRs?

    Rabea: Summarize everything for myself in my own words, that's what I have in front of me, not the curriculum itself. If I see something, I would create an issue or PR

    Fenne also makes their own summary/notes

    Mike: Making slides from scratch can help me prepare and summarize

    Toby preps similarly

    Amanda preps by making an Etherpad

    We'll continue to ask for testing at upcoming meetings

    Please read and share the blog announcement from our Executive Director regarding our response the the NSF Pose grant: https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/06/announcing-withdrawal-of-nsf-pose-proposal/

    See the post for ways to support us that are listed in the blog post

    We tend to not ask for donations within the communty because everyone is giving of their time

    We do provide resources to help you advocate for us

    Please share this blog post

    Rabea and Konrad: Will be having a session for German community members, could use as a template that we can share with the community

    This is a good time to encourage those who haven't been as active as a while to join us in various activities

    Fenne: esceince center in the Netherlands can have a new membership with The Carpentries, and we have funding to get 50 instructors in the Netherlands over the next 2 years!

    Sue: Talking to program officers personally can be helpful; someone at the NSF advocated for The Carpentries to get you in the running for this grant; there are people at the NSF who believe in what we're doing

    We will be using our second meeting this month, July 17. You are enouraged to join us with the conversation regarding AI/LLMs whether and how the Instructor Training curriculum should be updated

    First Thursday is primary, third Thursday is secondary

    The Instructor Trainers Leadership Committee is still accepting one additional member!

    1 meeting per month, help support trainers meeting, maybe some asynchronous work on projects such as what to cut guide from instructor training. (totalling roughly 5 hours a month)

    The Chair (Cera) and Secretary (Jesse) roles already are filled, so you don't need to worry about those!


    Topic of the month

    Continued discussion of what to cut, further development of documentation at https://codimd.carpentries.org/ttt-changes-working-dec2024?both#

    Amanda: How we Operate: Opportunities to cut how to make a workshop website. That was very confusing during her training. Sent ppl to the community session for how to build a workshop 

    Evgenij: Can be useful to explain the "slug"

    Nathaniel: Put this as an instructor note: If you skip this, make sure to explain the importance of the slug

    Maneesha: This is explained in the Welcome Session so it might be ok to skip the slug

    Jannetta: We go over the slug in the community session

    Jesse: Can build a lot of "working with your team" content through the previous days so you can go quickly through it at the end

    Knowing the roles is good

    A lot of the details could be cut or aligned with learner questions during the training

    Sher: I have combined the introductions in Launches and Landings with the last live coding exercise

    Evgenij: Instructor can note what they are skipping

    Nathaniel: I have a list for myself of what I think can be skipped; the Instructor Notes can be useful, especially after not having taught for a while

    Nathaniel: Some of the Building Skill with Feedback information can be abridged if it's integrated elsewhere as you teach (and/or model)

    Do the Minute Cards but don't teach it as a lesson

    Sher: How We Operate can be reduced because a lot of this information is presented in the Welcome Session

    Check out the Welcome Session slides to see what is taught so if you choose to remove information, you can see what will be repeated in the Welcome Session

    Etherpad: https://pad.carpentries.org/welcome-sessions-2025

    Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iHRmewLzcEhvk-foDt_CyLesT29wv64WWDtBg_duYas/edit#slide=id.g2e6d360ecbe_0_9

    Be more hesitant to skip what won't be covered in the Welcome Session

    Familiarize yourself with the Welcome Session to help you decide what to cut

    Jesse: Introductions can take a lot of time, which is fun but means we have to cut or speed up later!

    Flip side: If you have time, what do you want to spend more time on?

    Jesse: People want more time for activities in breakout rooms

    Maneesha: With only 4 people in my last training, timing wasn't an issue! Timing was much easier!

Agenda:

    Introductions

    Icebreaker: What do you like to do when you have a long weekend?

    Pre/post discussion

    Timing

    Agenda

    Liz: 24-27 June, ran training for small cohort 

    Mermaid chart https://www.mermaidchart.com/ transformed approach to teaching concept maps

    threw out slides and that helped to keep on time - used this to show an overview of the instructor training

    learner feedback - would have appreciated more framing of what they were going to see over the two days, esp. because they no longer get a course website with agenda, etc. 

    Work including Mermaid Chart as a PR or issue (How to incorporate?)

    When creating icons, used this AI Prompt: In my code, only "building skill with feedback" has an icon, on line 8. Please suggest icons for each level of the mindmap. Ensure they illustrate the topic concept. The audience are researchers who are preparing to teach foundational coding skills to their peers.

    Low learning curve/effort/time (~10-30 minutes)

    Copied a template

    Action: Liz will submit an issue with the mermaid chart of IT content.

    Took more time than putting name in an Etherpad, but the calendar invite was a nice trade-off!

    More convenient to not have to figure out the time zone prior to signing up, but less obvious how I could sign up for another event, and the confirmation email took a while to come, and the re-send email was blank

    Same issue with singing up for another event

    Also local timezones are displayed underneath, and viewing the calendar it's clear that it's in a US timezone. So I can't see the whole calendar in the framing of my own timezone. Whereas when I use something like whenisgood.net, I'm looking at a timetable in my local timezone, which is much easier to read. Not a dealbreaker, just that it is confusing because AU/NZ timezones are more or less directly opposite US.

    Hard rec to go back to the links on AI Liz shared. The podcast is excellent, and the webinar is worthwhile. posted June 29 in #trainers on Slack


    Topic of the month

    Continued discussion of what to cut, further development of documentation at https://codimd.carpentries.org/ttt-changes-working-dec2024?both#

    The website creation demo

    Now that we have the Welcome Session, there are sections in the How We Operate episode that can be cut because they'll be covered in the Welcome Session

    Check out the Welcome Session slides to see what is taught so if you choose to remove information, you can see what will be repeated in the Welcome Session

    Etherpad: https://pad.carpentries.org/welcome-sessions-2025

    The first day is too much with throwing information at people, not enough exercises

    If you add more exercises, you need to cut somthing

    concept mapping sometimes cut, instructors find it challenging

    What to not cut?

    Activities! and length of breakout rooms

    Leave enough time for thorough post-activity discussion - it's demotiving and breaks trust if post-discussion isn't given enough time and deliberation and acknowledgement of hard conversations the material generates

    Ask them to go into breakout rooms to discuss a concept before it's covered in the main room - if the summaries from the breakout rooms cover the topic - no need for instructors to cover it again. It's already done!

    Can summarize and expand on to the whole group

    Need to make sure to have enough time for discussion after activities - e.g. in the examples of motivating / demotivating examples from learners' past, need time to process these because they can be challenging

    note that this is a good opportunity to ask about what they would do differently

    Questioning the motivation behind further developing the what to cut issue: Do we not have enough documentation about what to cut? I'm noticing our discussion has moved toward classroom management rather than specific examples of what to cut

    maybe we just need guidance on what to cut if time gets short +1

    Has anyone run training where timing was perfect?

    Kind of - but only because we added an extra 2 hours to each day, so every activity had an extra 15 mins.

    The closest - has been related to the size of the cohort. Felt more easilyy managable around 15, but when I see a roster of 20 or so, we're going to run outta time. Also other factors like the dynamic of the cohort.

    As a trainer, you can feel like you're always rushing, even as there are sliences among the participants.

    Maintainer hat: what is the next step here? We have a lot of data, well anecdata, so is this enough info for maintainers group or IT committee to put together a proposal?

    Trainer perspective - the way we partition lessons to have a rec for 1 or 2 spots to cut. Often find out on the fly. Would feel more confident with that guidance.

    Action: TLC has a draft in progress - maybe we can share it with the community for comment?

    What's the next step? We have a lot of (anecdotal at the least) data!

    Recommendations by half-day or quarter-day of what to cut
