    Qn: the schedule for instructor training - I"vemoved over to 4 half days. Should trainers provide the schedule?

    https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/instructor/index.html#schedule

    There's an example in the index.md file at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcoliver/2024-07-22-ttt-online-PDT/refs/heads/gh-pages/index.md

    Topic of the month

    Check in: how are you are feeling and processing national and world events? How we can support Instructor Trainers' ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion.

    Perspective from another group - cultural competency, promote DEI. DC3 https://directory.library.duke.edu/dept/duke-collaboratory-for-classics-computing-dc3. In reality things are not necessarily as bad as they may seem in the media. Code of Conduct is more important than ever, keep working in that direction.

    Taking a break from the news - we can change what we do on a day to day basis. It's liberating.

    During the TLC meeting, shared that it is good to have this space - we're not always comfortable, we may speak from feeling instead of fact. Being a part of this community has helped a lot, and the Core Team has been supportive of each other. Being able to verbalize and express uncomfortableness. Scary to see how much work of our ancestors can be revoked. It's hard. Being in a space where we can voice that - we are making decisions as a community, we are being careful. There may be changes we can't anticipate. Offer and ask for support.

    Having control over our media consumption is critical at this time. How can we avoid an echo chamber? More conversation is needed with people we disagree with. Not sure how to do this. Has anyone tried this - going outside comfort zone and egaging with others we don't agree with.

    Read something useful about cutting through the media/noise. Important to address people who promote misinformation personally - avoid public shaming. Engage 1:1. The relationship with the person matters a lot. Having the conversation in person.

    Optimistic that the pendulum will swing back. We have an opportunity to diversify our actions, focus on actions. Often we engage with words, but we still have the actions we can make on a daily basis. Reflect values through actions.

    Challenge to find a balance between empathy and engagement. Difficulty of patience. Things are not going to happen overnight.

    Don't underestimate power of pervasiveness and persistance. Example of replacing dataset in a workshop, an incremental step, that supported diversity. Opportunity to do the work even if we're not talking about the work.

    Patience is uncomfortable. People have been playing a long game in terms of justice, and that helps appreciate how dignified and important patience is.

    News and social media - how to we balance engagement with space? One way is to engage with local causes, activities. Contribute to local communities, student labor unions. Make sure we stick to our core values. This is our community, and we can have a measurable impact. Even if it's small.

    What are other things we see that inspire or resonate? The DEIA episode in the training will resonate. We want to make the scientific community more diverse.

    Set boundaries. Doing something fun and funny. Kepp havig fun.

    Teaching a class, developing a lesson. Idea for the lesson came out of getting help with and helping people with code. Help learners engage with community.

    This is not a new thought but knowing what's sacred and keeping it sacred. Liz and Sher know about my dog walking and how important that is to me. I skip meeting and cancel meetings to keep that commitment. We're feeling the stress because we care, and it's good to create space.

    Local Jupyter project is exciting - scaling down made the project more open and accessible to the community. That is exciting.

    What other topics are you interested in discussing (or presenting!) at these meetings?

    What is your ultimate hack for preparing for TTT?
