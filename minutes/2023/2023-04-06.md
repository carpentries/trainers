**Agenda**:



* Introductions
* Pre and post Instructor Training discussion
* Mark: real life gets in the way of setup. Workshop is two weeks away and still have yet to talk to co-instructor. We will do it, but I was thrown into a talk that has hoovered up two weeks of my time. It was Carpentries-adjacent in that we created a bootstrapping mechanism for workshops. When I get into time-suck mode, it damanges my ability to correspondence. There is definitely an expert awareness gap with planning that happens with more experienced instruction. 
* Takeaway: recognise that each and every workshop is unique. A checklist would have been a huge savior here.
* Takeaway: real life happens. 
* Trisha: In between you and I teaching, Sarah Stevens and I are teaching IT next week locally. There is some level of comfort that comes having taught it many times before, but more preparation would be better
* Kelly: have you taught with the workbench yet, or is this going to be the first time? First time. Have you seen it?
* Mark: I have gone through with it. 
* Kelly: any questions about it? 
* Announcements
* With the workbench beta now complete, lessons that have not yet transitioned will do so soon. This means they need to have no waiting PRs. If you are teaching soon, please encourage trainees to submit *issues only* to any repository that is not yet using the Workbench. 
* If teaching Instructor Training in April 2023, please encourage trainees to comment on issues, etc but **not to open new pull requests** when you get to the discussion of Checkout. We need to close all outstanding PRs before the lessons can be transitioned and the Workbench is scheduled to be rolled out across all official lessons at the beginning of May.
* The Instructor Training curriculum is officially out of beta! Links to the curriculum homepage will now point directly to the Workbench version.
* If you have stored or bookmarked links to specific pages other than the main page, those links may no longer work. Check your link address for "/index.html" and delete it to fix the link. For example, [https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/index.html](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/index.html) no longer works, but [https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout) does.
* Questions about the Workbench? Contact Zhian on Slack or via zkamvar@carpentries.org or open a discussion in [https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/discussions](https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/discussions)

**Agenda**:



* Introductions
* Pre and post Instructor Training discussion
* Ariel: Where are the lessons? What do they look like? Haven't explored the whole workbench experience yet. 
* Teaching demo on the day it switched over and all links were broken (oops!)
* Jon: forgot in post-discussion from last time but will take a long look at the checkout episode. That took 90 minutes last time, not sure if that was me or them or the episode itself. 
* Karl: That episode had more questions than any other episode over 2 days. Very process-oriented group.
* Jon: A lot of the questions were repeated. We had covered them already. Maybe front-loading to anticipate?
* Ariel: also first 2-day event in a while, so will be a different cadence
