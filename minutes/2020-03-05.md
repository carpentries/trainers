### Topic of the month: CarpentryCon 2020!
- Sign up for lightning talks/poster presentations now
- "Pico" presentations at EGR?
- https://egu2019.eu/abstracts_and_programme/pico.html
- Incentives for new instructors - offering something that is marked as peer reviewed means people can treat it like a normal conference. Solve for people's promotion models. Can they put it on their CV/promotion docs?
- Local improve group at CarpentryCOnnect Otago -- went over really really well with everyone
- Question: none of the submissions have deadlines on them. This is disconcerting -- has a secret deadline passed? When should we hear back? Soft deadlines or rolling etc.
- Deadlines for financial aid are rolling and contingent upon sponsorship. Will clarify that language. LIghtning talks and poster sessions... did put a deadline on proposals for talk or workshop and should be accepting within next week or so.
- Day 3 lots of open sessions first two days sort of numbered. When will it be more fleshed out? Will a lot still be up in the air unconference style?
- There will be a birds-of-a-feather type thing, so there will be a little structure and also a lot of unconferencey things. At 2018 we had a board up for meetups. Maybe having subcommunity meetups
- In other news... COVID-19. As of right now we are still proceeding as planned. However we are looking heavily at UW if they have bans, airlines, governments, decisions etc. April 1 will announce whether it will proceed as in-person or virtual conference. Either way something will happen.
- Appreciate the specificity in what will factor in to decision making
- Global conference, so many factors. Right now people would be looking to buy tickets. But. So we do need to be as clear as we can. Even if we do have a virtual conference we want it to be accessible.
- One of the big things likely to affect international people is what travel insurance is doing. Medical insurance in particular is really scary. Brian says they have been banned for all international travel (By MQ -- anticipate other workplaces doing this? NZ is still travel but heavily reduced but no insurance avaialble for covid) for the foreseeable future.
