    Slides --> https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SdeTGbleVqrJOsHxBVaJx22b62bczm4q1ux-D0SRlcY/

    Officially launching in April

    Some history

    Started in 2016 and prices stayed the same until 2022

    2022 price increase and geographically tiered system

    Peak for membership was in 2021 with 100 members

    2024 Membership model task force, resulting in six recommendations

    From membership to partnership: emphasize bi-directional relationship

    What is changing

    New services: collaborative lesson development training, one-day instructor training, short professional development sessions.

    Learner centered training was discussed 6 November meeting

    GitHub repo: https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training-lct

    More flexible tiers: ratio of services that can be combined

    Service discounts: percentage based on roles

    New pricing tables

    Questions, thoughts, comments:

    Can these tiers be flexible during a membership year? No

    Are there geographically tiered prices for lower income countries? Yes and ratio stays the same

    If we are renewing in February, will we still be on the old model, or will we we renew on this model? yes and no; talk to Erin






    Reach out to Erin with more in depth questions on Calendly

    Very interactive group, a fun time. Prepared for feedback on delivery - different use of Powerpoint, received some feedback about that.

    Callout to Nathaniel re use of Excalidraw for teach/don't teach section

    e.g., updating Etherpad templates, going through instructor notes, how to teach concept maps, hackathons 

     would like to discuss whether others may see a need in their communities for a re-cert type Instructor Training, a shortened version (4 hours max). For those who have done instructor but maybe it's been awhile and they could use a refresher

     wondering if it's too early to talk about AI again - maybe even talk about some of the recent posts and discussions in the vibe-coding community about why you *shouldn't* vibe code if you're learning (that's actually been happening -- the discussions, I mean!) -- (Cera, I'd be willing to help lead)

     dedicated focused sessions about inclusive and accessible training

    Slides --> https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SdeTGbleVqrJOsHxBVaJx22b62bczm4q1ux-D0SRlcY/

    Context:

    Membership program started in 2016, goal was to help promote community development within institutions

    Update to pricing model in 2022

    Drop in membership levels since COVID-19, due to various factors

    Membership Model Task Force (2024) - six recommendations for redesign; launching in April

    Partnership rather than membership - bi-directional, relational

    Core services remain; new tiers based on org size, goals, World Bank categorization

    Changes: new programs, tiers, expanded service discounts

    New programs:

    Collaborative Lesson Development

    Learner Centered Teaching

    Short format professional development sessions

    Partnership tiers - more flexible and customizable

    Service model provides recognition for time

    What about multiple people as trainers in the same organization?

    Questions:

    What about multiple trainers in the same org? 

    Each can qualify for the 30% discount, which at 2 would max out the discount for that org

    How much has the board been involved in the plan?

    Some invovled in original membership plan and have signed off on changes over time

    With Collaborative Lesson Development training, expectation that lessons developed get submitted to the Incubator?

    No - it can happen, but is not expected or required

    With modularization of learner centered training, is there a path for those who complete the first day to come back and finish the full training later?

    At this point, no. It would be challenging to allow people to sign up for just day 2. But if a person is in the learner centered training and wants to complete day 2 of that same training, that can be worked out.
