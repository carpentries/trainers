    Topic of the month

    Creating a rubric to identify items to cut from Instructor Training

    https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/01-welcome.html

    Making sure everyone has the same information on what is good to cut

    What is your understanding of the purpose and goal of our Instructor Training curriculum?

    Broadest goal is to help people become better Instructors by giving them the tools to create an open and inviting environment 

    Introducing people to the culture of The Carpentries, the pedagogy follows. The culture of how to do things is most important and then the pedagogy is a longer term thing

    The info that instructors need to know to teach

    My priorities for instructor training are - helping instructors realize they can improve their teaching with feedback, giving them a foundation of pedagogy and education research, giving examples of how those practices are implemented in workshops, and sharing info about the Carpentries community. As well as things not to do

    Give the new instructors a solid foundation in our pedagogy

    The pedagogy is the culture, since it gets across our philosophy so well.

    What are the areas you are cutting and why? What can we cut without taking away from the goals of Instructor Training?

    Four Half Day

    Cut a few exercises from first half day

    Customzed memory and cognition - after the memory test - what strategies did you use? connect it to learning practices (ie. chunking, etc.). Skip the next exercises

    Building skill with feedback - see it as a reminder to ask for feedback. Don't spend long on it here, don't spend time on the feedback mechanisms - show through doing

    Third half day  

    prapring to teach. Many things have already been mentioned. Skim through and mention anything that hasn't already been mentioned. One big thing to keep is preparing to cut, give suggestions

    Last half day -

    cut from woring with your team. Have already covered alot of it earlier in the training. Focus on sticky situations rather than the text included. Spend more time with code of conduct because people are uncomfortable with it. Let them know it's not common.

    Skip planning together/setting up a workshop website - point them to Jannetta's sessions

    Launches and landings - skip first exercise. Give them what should be an introdcution and let them practice. Mention last moments and then move on to putting it together

    Launches and Landings - cut and talk about it some with the demo. Could be merged together.

    Keep intros bc feedback from learners - they say they don't think about that 

    When you are planning to cut, how do you or do you model the fact that you are cutting things and how you made that decision, ie. on the fly, plan ahead, etc?

    I mention episodes and give people a preview if I skip a whole episode - suggesting they read it, it is a good read.

    I do sometimes mention I’m skipping a section for time or because we’ve already covered it

    Other times I just cut on the fly and don’t mention what I’m cutting, probably more so at the beginning I do this when we are talking about how learning works more.  I mention cutting more when we get to sections where we are giving practical advice for applying this knowledge

    At the begining of each half day, take 15-20 minutes going over feedback and questions. That takes away from other peices of curriculum. Decided ahead of time what would be condensed/taken away and shared with the trainees what we wouldn't be spending time on it

    Could add to the Instructor notes that we recognise you may have to cut additional material outside what is suggested and recommend how to do it (plan ahead, mention it to the learners, direct learners to resources for covering on their own)

    Feedback from Instructors who recently went through training - emphasis on checkout steps is important. Take time with this. 

    Ensure the trainees know about the welcome session - great source of support and information. Breaks down the how we operate section even further, what they need to know to become an Instructor/check out. 

    New trainers - when you were shadowing/going through the curriculum, were there sections you felt were too long/too much time was spent on?

    Lots of nos

    Mental models and misconseptions - has anyone every skipped this? It is more a consideration when creating a lesson. Should be written for creating the lesson but not sure if it needs to be a huge consideration for the training if you won't be creating anything yourself 

    this feedback has been shared before - something for us to consider and take back to curriculum development team to make sure it is in that curriculum. Sher will put an issue in for the maintainers

    Folks love discussing misconceptions but it is more lesson dev

    Sher will take this information to the TLC and put it together to circulate. Would love for it to be a live doc and get feedback. We will continue to build on this and allow the new trainers to get an opportuity to teach so everyone can add to the convo. Hope to have it solidified by next quarter.

Training discussion (pre and post):

    Jon Wheeler (he/him), University of New Mexico; post

    Energy level was different possbily due to the election. 

    The participants were engaged however it started off as 12 and ended with 9

    Jordan Pedersen offered to rearrange the How we operate as a group effort however it was not piloted. Would like to try it again 

    David: Is there a plan to do try the flipped excercise? 

    Jon: will try in 2025 after you sign up

    Topic of the month

    Creating a rubric to identify items to cut from Instructor Training

    Preapring to teach section - needed to finihs up equity/inclusion/accessibility was more crucial to their workshop section. Preapring to teach is a section that they could back and review. What is the most important things people can take away. What is priority 

    In any lesson  we can't teach all of the content, so we have to make decisions about what to cut? How are these decisions made differently during an instructor training versus a technical workshop?

    Trainers have flexibility to try things. Some may have preferences to cover certain sections, which is fine but can lead to different experience for the trainees. So there may be gaps in terms of the info trainees receivem. Interested in prioritizing things we might most often cut so that learners/trainees are all getting the same information.

    So there may be less flexibility to cut in a TTT rather than a technical workshop.

    Sara: Tend to cut the more procedural content, as opposed to sections that are open to interpretation. For example, EIA is important to cover to make sure everyone is on the same page.

    Scott: Does anyone ever get through the whole lesson? Compared with technical workshops where we often don't get all the way through the shell, are there conventional things that are more often skipped?

    Liz: Cutting stuff from the last quarter, especially some of the more reflective activities is common but we want to try leaving time for group rather than individual reflection. For example, do 1 up 1 down rather than loading up on a bunch of activities in the last hour/half hour, eg the individual concept maps.

    Sher: Before we did the welcome sessions for checkout, it was important to cover the content in How We Operate sections, but now a lot of that information is covered in the welcome session so while it is still important to cover things like checkout and aspects of how we operate, it is possible to spend less time on some of these details. So we are interested in finding out sections or parts of the workshop content that may be shortened or combined with other sections.

    Jeff: Second Liz's comment about asking trainees to do one more thing at the end of a workshop. Prefer to skip exposition over activites - try to keep activities and interactive stuff included. 

    Jon: EIA starts out activity heavy but then goes into lectury so switched it up and headed to to introduction. 

    Sher: Once we gather this information, ideally what would be the most helpful way to share or publish? How would this resource look to you? We're talking about things to cut, and also things to minimize, or to combine. What would be the best way to present/organize this information?

    Joel: Maybe in instructor notes: This is the core set of things we encourage everyone to cover, and here are the sections you could shorten or skip. There is something along these lines in the instructor notes already (https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/instructor/instructor-notes.html#curriculum), but it could be refined and emphasized. See the SWC r-novice-gapminder lesson for an example (https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/instructor/instructor-notes.html#lesson-plans).

    Scott: Some way to prioritize based on time. A way of determining what ought to have been covered by a certain point, and prioritizing changes based on what is left to cover.

    Sher: Last training was a 4 day training, and each day the team got together and discussed what might be cut or reorganized the next day. How do others approach this?

    Sara: Worked with an instructor who had a concept of a 'crumple zone,' sense of which things could be compressed. But we generally let the learners know when we cut something. The four day workshops tend to allow more time for reflection. Encourage learners to look at the material that was skipped with the possibility of coming back to it later for further discussion.

    Scott: Maybe in a shorter day it is a good option to let the learners review some things on their own and come back the next day with any questions to discuss.

    Sher: Like the idea of putting the onus on the learners to engage more with the material.

    Jon: Trainees are reluctant to do the homework. Increasingly they come and still haven't picked a lesson. have to readjust the lesson sometimes to give people the time to identify a lesson to teach. Everyone doesn't always do the homework and not sure what more homework would do. 

    it is late for some trainees and do not have time to review at the end. 

    Liz: important to recognize that is the reality of our learners that sometimes they don't have time

    Jon: sometimes the drive for cutting is based on what the learners have not prepared for

    Scott: Is there a way to get the curriculum cut shorter to ensure that we get through everything. ie, having them attend a workshop website as a 4th checkout 

    Sher: We have cut things entirely from the curriculum before. Currently one thing we talk about possible cutting altogether is lesson development.

    Murray: The four day format is useful and the shorter days allow for more time for learners to do the homework.

    Next steps: will look at this info with the TLC to start putting it together.

    Jon: combining was done more in the previous ITT rather than cutting.
