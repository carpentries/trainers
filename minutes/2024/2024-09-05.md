    Zac: Rob and Erin volunteered to help out bc co-instructor had potential issues with being able to teach. Great having backup

    The sooner we know if you need back up, the better! Rob and Erin enjoyed being able to join as backup and finding places where we can improve our curriculum, etc. You may see more team trainers around to review

    Introductions

    Pre/post discussion

    Below from Ben with permission:

    What are some strategies for (trying to) engage with folks who are are persistently unsupportive of or disengaged with:

    How the lesson material is being presented (which involves using the etherpad, breakout rooms, the activities, and so forth)

    The lesson material itself

    What the Carpentries are all about

    Sara: One way to approach that is whether this (the Carpentries) is the right place for learners who are this disenaged. We can accept feedback, but the content/lessons/process are well vetted and unlikely to change in some of the ways that were proposed in feedback. Sometimes the evening or late hours can make it more difficult and we can also recommend a person scheduling a workshop in their timezone.

    Jake: Something brought up in these meetings before but no concensus yet, but there are times when as trainers we learn things about the trainees that should be disqualifying but might not come up in a teaching demonstration. A person who is this disengaged could do a completely adequate teaching demo.

    Sara: Sometimes there are red flags and we don't always have a way to deal with it. 

    Jon: We also got some non-constructive negative feedback in the post workshop survey.

    Sara: Some people may feel that they are forced to be there - many are motivated, but a person may get messages that a workshop isn't for them but they stick with it anyway.

    Jake: If that is how a person feels, regardless of if they want to quit or not, we should have a way of disqualifying them.

    Sara: There is some self-selection since the person may not end up completing checkout.

    Jon: There was a suggestion for an accelerated training program for people who have a certain amount of experience.

    Jake: It would be difficult to make such a determination.

    Sara: It's still important to spend the time to build the community. That can be hard to get across when people are coming from different geographical regions.

    (Also from Ben) Supporting learners who are fatigued from long/late days. Angelique provided us some guidance (such as encouraging folks to move around), but do others have other advice/thoughts? I had someone email me apologizing that they missed the last hour because they accidentally fell asleepâ€”eesh!

    Sara: Engage learners with fun.

    Jake: With cameras off it can be good to check if people are at their keyboards - ask for feedback, green and red checks.

    Sara: Checking in, asking direct questions. Make sure you have called on everyone over the course of the workshop. Create an expectation that people will be called on. Can be challenging and not everyone is comfortable with it. Moving around is good - recommend people to go outside and get something to show everyone (a flower, a rock, etc.). Play music or something.

    The Core Team is in the process of developig a new Carpentries website. Would like to include an Instructor Training FAQ on the website for potential trainees. 

    What are some of the questions you are frequently asked by trainees?

    Add to the document linked on line 127

    Need permission to access doc?

    How do the teaching demos actually work? What does a demo actually look like and what is expected of the trainees?

    What lessons are okay for the demo?

    How do I find other instructors?

    How do I know what's going on the in Community? How maintain community?

    Leaders help - someone to keep things moving

    Get people together for events, help build regional networks and teams

    How far are people allowed to deviate from the curriculum? Why do we ask them to stick so closely to curriculum?

    Reduces prep time

    Creates consistency with online materials that learners may refer to later

    Avoid a lot of errors and confusion

    For centrally organized workshops, helps make sure you can plan appropriately with co-instructor

    Materials are well vetted.

    We like to know that people are receiving consistent info/materials across workshops

    The volunteer aspect can be problematic - often it works best where instructors are paid (maybe not in the sense of an honorarium/stipend to do a workshop, but to know that they have the support of their organizations for travel, release time for work). So as a question - how are instructors supported for their efforts? How can instructors get buy-in and support from their organization when needed?

    Maybe some template text to propose to admins?
