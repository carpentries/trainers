Pre/post discussion

     Christian - 2 weeks ago there were only 12. A lot of discussions 

     question, leaving out content? 

    Great discussion to 

    Sher!: We've had this discussion before, it would be a good thing to have a list of suggestions as to what is most likely to be cut out 

    Jake: I always emphasize that the teaching materials are too ambitious, and that needing to skip things is not a reflection of either the instructor/trainer, or the learners/trainees. I think the curriculum has advice to skip specific sections. “Preparing to teach” maybe?

    Samantha: I know that I spend more time on accessibility and EDI than some other trainers. I was in a session when someone did try to cover all of it, was almost impossible as a learner to keep up

    Lisanna: If the situation allows, I use the need to skip stuff to discuss how useful it is to have access to extensive training materials after the course

    Updates from the Curriculum Team

    To all Instructors teaching Data Carpentry Ecology workshops: please read the blog post announcing the scheduled adoption of a fully-redesigned version of the R Ecology lesson 

    https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/03/dc-r-ecology-adoption/

    The current version of the lesson will be replaced on 8th July 2024. 

    The new version has received excellent feedback from the Instructors who have taught it so far, and we recommend that you try using it even if you are planning to teach the curriculum before that date.

    Relevant to Trainers: the list of starting points for teaching demos will be updated when the new version is adopted in July, and you may wish to familiarise yourself with the lesson content (currently at https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson-alternative/, but will move to https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/ on 8th July)

    Wherever you are starting from, you have to have your setup in order. 

    let ppl start wherever, just knowing where they need to start

    most of the teaching demos and they are starting from the beginning and do not get into the code. 

    5 min is not enough to make the deicisions 

    if you say you can start where you like... may need to 

    say 1 minute of context (introduction) then use 4 minutes 


Make an update to the template and let them know the purpose of the demo... 
include: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NCpPk8jvQo
extra annotion in learner view to have demo view.... or through glossario 



Discussion 
Trainee next steps for becoming Certified Instructor: 
why we spend a lot of time on the How we operate
the timeline ends at 2018 (https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/15-carpentries.html#a-brief-history)
make the Get involved step more clearer
canvas those who are interested in moving forward and connect them with a local champion 
send a followup email to re-engage
people asking if they want to be helper? how do they become a helper 

Curriculum: 

    people get confused the difference between a lesson and episode.
