    Updates from the Curriculum Team

    To all Instructors teaching Data Carpentry Ecology workshops: please read the blog post announcing the scheduled adoption of a fully-redesigned version of the R Ecology lesson 

    https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/03/dc-r-ecology-adoption/

    The current version of the lesson will be replaced on 8 July 2024. 

    The new version has received excellent feedback from the Instructors who have taught it so far, and we recommend that you try using it even if you are planning to teach the curriculum before that date.

    Training calendar for next quarter published, with new scheduling format (providing dates and having Instructors sign up) - 11 total events scheduled

    Topic of the month

    Special Guest - Instructor Jennifer Stubbs - The value of slow introductory basics

    Questions:

    Comfort level with going slow?  Discomfoft with 10 seconds of silence when taking a temperature check?

    Not the absolute slowest need, but balance

    Speed = "competence"

    How are you Adjusting to online workshop: screen navigation, real estate managment of one screen (wth smartphone), so many chat options and the screen is stolen when the instructor shares screen

    How to activate the early episodes via slides, heavy with lecture?

    https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/foundational-computer-skills/

    https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-computational-thinking

    Is this a Curriculum committee project or a publicity project to integrate computational thinking in?  Or introduction to hosts hiring a workshop.

    Maybe a game about shell: Folder structure through fridge metaphor (drawers, produce inside).

    Pre/post discussion

     Sher co taught with Erin. Different approach to slides, interesting feedback from the students who appreciated having slides. Very helpful to have the slides as a guide, but also great for learners to have the visual aid. Also provides something else to look at on the first day of a four day training.

    Paula: Slides can support engagement, can be fun and lighten things up

    Jake: Started using slides a few trainings ago. Not all available slide sets are current with the curriculum. Good to have the visual, but hard to know which is the most current version.

    Jon: Slides can create a focal point for learners, reduce cognitive load.

    Murray: Use slides often, something for people to look at during the talk-heavy parts. People can read while instructors are explaining things.

    Pao: Is there research into pros/cons of slides but people need them and may expect them. People need to see something. But it can be nice to keep the focus on the conversation. Would be interesting to learn of research or what is best for learning.

    Sher: Some learners will like slides, some won't. We can be flexible.

    Murray: Managing slides in terms of switching screens and modes can be distracting. Good to be mindful of how we manage learners' screens.

    Update from the Trainers Leadership Committee (Liz Stokes)

    Apologies for the radio silence, we've been getting our heads around processes and expectations. Like many open source, volunteer projects, we have been given a list of excellent ideas with enthusiasitc backing from past committees, but actual progress has been slow. While we clear the backlog, 2 priorities have been identified:

    1. A guide for running Trainer meetings - to increase transparency and invite participation in trainer meetings from the trainer community. More details: https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/201 

    2. Supporting automation of trainer status renewal - where we develop a rubric to guide edge cases which would normally be discussed with the Director of Workshops and Training. https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/261

    Scheduled 11 instructor training events for Q3 - thank you everyone for your participation. Hope that the new process was useful for everyone, we will try it again for Q4.

    How to activate the early episodes via slides, heavy with lecture?

    Maybe a game about shell: Folder structure through fridge metaphor (drawers, produce inside). Found a near option:  https://medium.com/applab/app-lab-programming-lab-1-5f5459709c72

Responses:

    long pause strategy from 7th grade: 8-10 seconds I don't mind waiting to relieve the tension and welcome the time to reflect rather than immediacy.

    Wait out the length of silence: explore the discomfort together

    RegEx is rather advanced; risky to assume of novices.

    strategic pause: use them to moderate pace of workshop.  Space-time for cognitive load to catch up.  No need to rush to new content because feedback of accumulating knowledge.

    need introduction to your hard drive and folder hierarchies: What IS a file?  What IS a folder? And this affects R or Python

    How to approach new noviceness level

    How to welcome with cake to motivate to eat their broccoli (show case the visualizations and power-use in order to motivate attention and engagement through computational foundations).

    Encourage more experienced instructors to lead first sessions bring confidence to slow down while keeping students motivated.  Have seen brand-new instructors rush through content ineffectively, so encourage first workshop to lead later sections, not day 1, part 1.

    Power dynamics and business perspective of host-request and Carpentry pedagogy/model
