## Changes to Instructor Checkout

One of the key roles of the Trainer Leadership Committee is to "Oversee changes to Instructor checkout requirements". In late 2022 members of the Core Team led a project to review the Instructor Checkout process for the first time in nearly five years. In particular, the review focussed on what the community considered to be the purpose of Checkout, and whether there were requirements that could be changed or removed to reduce the dropout rate of Instructor trainees through the Checkout process. 

The Trainer Leadership Committee worked closely with Kelly Barnes and Karen Word on this review, providing feedback on behalf of themselves and the Trainer community, and advising on communication activities to maximise community engagement and acceptance of review findings. Ultimately substantial changes were proposed for all aspect of the Checkout process, and the Committee continues to support Karen on the process, timelines and implementation of these changes.
