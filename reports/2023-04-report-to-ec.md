# April 2023 Trainer Leadership Report to EC

## Summary

As the Trainers Leadership committee enters its third year, it has also started a stage of renewal with only one member of the original committee remaining in the role after the elections early in 2023 (positions are limited to a maximum of three consecutive terms). This has in part been because of a conscious decision by committee members to not all stand for re-election and so ensure a gradual turnover of representatives rather than a sudden full replacement, but has of course led to some loss of experience and institutional knowledge. The new committee has rapidly come to terms with their responsibilities though, and it is very encouraging to see a good level of interest from the community in taking up these roles.

## Changes to Instructor Checkout

One of the key roles of the Trainer Leadership Committee is to "Oversee changes to Instructor checkout requirements". In late 2022 members of the Core Team led a project to review the Instructor Checkout process for the first time in nearly five years. In particular, the review focussed on what the community considered to be the purpose of Checkout, and whether there were requirements that could be changed or removed to reduce the dropout rate of Instructor trainees through the Checkout process. 

The Trainer Leadership Committee worked closely with the Director of Assessment and the Director of Instructor Training on this review, providing feedback on behalf of themselves and the Trainer community, and advising on communication activities to maximise community engagement and acceptance of review findings. Ultimately substantial changes were proposed for all aspect of the Checkout process, and the Committee continues to support the core team Directors on the process, timelines and implementation of these changes.

 ## Leadership elections
 
Committee elections were held during the reporting period, with three of the 2022 committe opting not to stand for re-election; we thank these members (Sarah Brown, Jeff Oliver and Bonny Adane Bayissa) for their contributions to the committee. The outgoing committee assisted the Director of Instructor Training with coordination and communication around the election process, and reviewed ways to streamline the process for the following year.

## Trainer certification renewal

Last year the committee and the Director of Instructor Training implemented a system for annual Trainer status renewal. While this was broadly successful, there is opportunity for refinement to further automate the process and reduce demands on Trainers and the Director alike. The committee is currently working on finalising and implementing these refinements.

## Looking Forward 

A priority for the next few months is to update the [Trainer Responsibilities statement](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/184), explicitly reinstating the expectations for Trainers which were overlooked when the Trainer Agreement was replaced by the Trainer Certification Renewal process. The committee will also continue to support the implementation of the checkout and certification renewal processes, and work on ways to further improve community engagement with Trainer meetings.
