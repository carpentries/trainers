# September 2023 Trainer Leadership Report to EC

## Summary

This report covers the first six-month term of the 2023-24 Trainers Leadership Committee, a period during which significant change has occurred to Instructor Training through the update of the Instructor Checkout requirements. Despite the workload associated with that project, the Committee has also made good progress on a number of other issues, and continues to address Trainer engagement, training policy, and operational matters.

## Changes to Instructor Checkout

Completion of the project to update Instructor Checkout requirements has been a major focus of the Trainer Leadership Committee during the report period. The Committee continued to worked closely with the Director of Instructor Training to finalise details of the updates, to identify tasks and requirements to be completed before implementation, to confirm timing and logistics of the change-over process, and to assist with communications to the Trainer community. The changes have now gone live, with widespread positive feedback, and the Committee would like to thank all involved in this process for their hard work in making this major project so successful.

## Implementation of Trainer Status Renewal

In 2022 the Trainers Leadership Committee and the Director of Instructor Training implemented a system for annual Trainer status renewal. Review of this system once in practice identified opportunities to further automate the process and reduce demands on Trainers and the Director alike. However it proved unrealistic to apply further changes in parallel to the workload of the Instructor Checkout project, so the Committee agreed on a lightweight process for renewal in 2023 with updates to be finalised and applied for 2024 Trainer renewals. Committee members also provided input to some other Carpentries committees which were considering introducing status renewal models.

## Evaluation of Changes to Trainer Meeting Schedule

One incidental finding of the Trainer Status Renewal project was that some Trainers have difficulty attending either of the monthly Trainer meetings because neither occur at a practical time in their timezone. The Committee reviewed the feedback around this issue and approved the rescheduling of the later of the two meetings from 2200 UTC to 2300 UTC on a trial basis; attendance will be monitored over the next few months to see if this enables more or fewer participants to attend this meeting.

## Revise Trainer Community Responsibilities

The Committee updated the Trainer Community Responsibilities listed in the Powers and Responsibilities document, explicitly reinstating the expectations for Trainers which were overlooked when the Trainer Agreement was replaced by the Trainer Certification Renewal process.

## Recommendation to Maintainers re Controversial Pull Request

During the reporting period a community member submitted a pull request to alter the Instructor Training material by removing an example that they felt was discriminatory to individuals holding certain fundamental beliefs. The example however was based on strong and widely accepted scientific evidence, so the maintainers referred this request to the Committee for review. Ultimately, following consultation with the broader Trainer community, the Committee recommended to the maintainers that they reject the request. This was based on balancing the need to support inclusivity against the Carpentries committment to evidence-based training, and to avoid setting a precedent where an individual's personal beliefs might be used to argue for the removal of aspects of the training material with which they might disagree. The Committee also recommended that potentially controversial topics such as this should be submitted as Issues for community discussion rather than Pull Requests for approval (or not) by the maintainers.

## Looking Forward 

The Committee is approaching its annual elections, and will aim to initiate this process slightly earlier than last year to reduce disruption from various holiday periods around the world (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year, Southern hemisphere summer holidays). Both the current and subsequently the new Committee are expected to prioritize the Trainer Status Renewal project mentioned above.
