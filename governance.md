All [Instructor Trainers](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/duties_agreement.html) with Active [status](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/duties_agreement.html#trainer-alumni-status) who are not part of the [Carpentries Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) will be eligible to vote in elections.

New Members will be elected each year as vacancies occur. A general timeline for elections will occur annually as follows:
* Mid November: The Core Team Liaison identifies a point of contact for the election. This person may be the Core Team Liaison or any Trainer not standing for election.
* Early December: Elections announced, Self-nominations open
* Late January: Self-nominations close, entries posted, dedicated Trainer meeting held to introduce candidates
* Early February: Trainers vote 
* March 1: Responsibility transferred to new Members

If the seat of a Member becomes vacant after March 1 but before December 1, the Committee will attempt to fill the seat with a non-elected nominee from the most recent election, in the order of votes received. If this fails, the Committee may appoint any Active Trainer to fill the seat until the next election.

Elections will be conducted using a [Single Transferable Vote](https://electionbuddy.com/features/voting-systems/stv-voting) (STV) preferential selection system. 
In the event that more than 15 eligible candidates self-nominate for election, a primary using the same system will be held first, with the top 10 candidates 
standing for final election.


## Ratification and Governance

This document, once approved by [The Carpentries Executive Council](https://carpentries.org/governance/), will go into effect when a first election of leadership takes place.

Changes to Committee documentation may come from the Leadership or the Trainer community. 
To make changes:


1. The trainer community should be notified one week prior to a regularly scheduled 
trainer meeting that the meeting topic will include changes to trainer governance. The 
notification must include the changes to be discussed and an asynchronous means for
engagement.
1. After the dedicated meeting, an additional one week to comment and propose revisions
to the change. 
1. After the two week comment period, changes will be enacted if ratification is not required.
1. If ratification is required, proposal moves to a vote among all Trainers.
1. All documentation changes will be submitted to the Executive Council with regular required reports. Any requested changes will be processed as above.

A proposal is adopted with a quorum of 60% of Active badged Trainers voting (for,against, 
or abstain) and 75% of the votes in favor. New documentation goes into effect immediately upon approval. 

## Removal

If a Member consistently fails to meet the obligations outlined above, they may be removed by a unanimous vote of the other Members. A vote to remove a Member 
must be announced in writing (in the meeting agenda) to all Members at least ten days in advance to vote on the removal. A vacated seat will be filled following 
the procedure outlined in the Nominations and Elections section.
