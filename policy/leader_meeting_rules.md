# Governance: Martha's Rules

The trainer leadership panel uses [Martha's Rules][marthas-rules] for making decisions.  The
first section below describes these rules; the second lists voting members of
the project and explains how to become one, while the third lists decisions made
to date.

## Making Decisions

1.  Before each meeting, anyone who wishes may sponsor a proposal by filing an
    issue in the GitHub repository tagged "proposal".  Proposals must be filed
    at least 24 hours before a meeting in order to be considered at that
    meeting, and proposals will be assigned to milestones to indicate what meeting 
    they will be considered at. A proposal must include:
    -   a one-line summary (the subject line of the issue)
    -   the full text of the proposal
    -   any required background information
    -   pros and cons
    -   possible alternatives

2.  A quorum is established in a meeting if four or more of voting members are
    present.

3.  Once a person has sponsored a proposal, they are responsible for it.  The
    group may not discuss or vote on the issue unless the sponsor or their
    delegate is present.  The sponsor is also responsible for presenting the
    item to the group.

4.  After the sponsor presents the proposal, a sense vote is cast for the
    proposal prior to any discussion:
    -   Who likes the proposal?
    -   Who can live with the proposal?
    -   Who is uncomfortable with the proposal?

5.  If all of the group likes or can live with the proposal, it is immediately
    accepted with no further discussion.

6.  If most of the group is uncomfortable with the proposal, it is postponed for
    further rework by the sponsor.

7.  If any members are uncomfortable they can briefly state their objections.  A
    timer is then set for a brief discussion moderated by the facilitator.
    After 10 minutes or when no one has anything further to add (whichever comes
    first), the facilitator calls for a yes-or-no vote on the question: "Should
    we implement this decision over the stated objections?"  If a majority votes
    "yes" the proposal is implemented.  Otherwise, the proposal is returned to
    the sponsor for further work.

8. Once a proposal has been raised during a meeting, final approval may occur asynchronously.

## Suffrage

    -   Mark Crowe

2.  To become a voting member:
    1.  [Members must be elected](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/governance.md#nominations-and-elections)

3.  Voting members may resign from the project at any time, or [be removed](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/governance.md#removal).  For 2021-2022 term, consideration for removal occurs after 3 unexplained no-shows. 

## Recording Decisions


Accepted proposals will be linked to in the associated meeting minutes. Proposals may involve adding resources to this repository, these proposals' issues should be closed when the the pull request for the addition is merged.  For proposals that do not involve adding resources, they may be closed when otherwise acted upon. 

## Leadership Panel Meeting Minutes

Meeting minutes will be added as a pull request by a submitter (secretary or delegate) and all members of the panel will review and approve the pull request.  The minutes will be merged for record after all voting members have approved the current version, any member who was not last to approve or Core Team members may merge minutes. If a month has elapsed after the most recent approval, and no further discussions on the meeting have been raised, any leadership member or Core Team member may merge minutes.

## Specific Minutes Sharing Procedure

- Proposals for upcoming meetings will be submitted as issues in the public trainers repository, and are always viewable by everyone
- Meeting minutes will be taken in a private space that is limited to Trainer Leadership
- During each meeting, as topics are discussed the group will decide if the upcoming topic should be redacted. If so, notes will not be recorded. Meeting minutes will be briefly discussed at the end of each meeting to determine if further redactions are needed
- the Secretary will make a Pull request to the public trainers repository with the public meeting notes
- Approval/edits of the minutes by Trainers Leadership will proceed from there 

Important notes:
- Unredacted minutes will never be posted to GitHub
- Names of Trainer Leadership (who said what) will not be redacted
- Names and identifying details of non-Leadership persons under discussion will sometimes be redacted. 
- Content associated with names and identifying details of non-Leadership persons under discussion will sometimes be redacted.
   - Redactions will only be made for identifying information that may adversely affect the person under discussion. This includes but is not necessarily limited to: Trainers Application decisions and recruitment decisions. Conversations that feature a great deal of identifying information may be redacted in full as in `<trainer applications were discussed>`
- Trainer Leadership is not *required* to redact identifying information in cases where the benefit to disclosing that information to the Trainer Community would outweigh any negatives, such as offering congratulations. 
- This procedure is subject to any applicable Carpentries privacy policies, and in cases where they conflict the Carpentries Privacy Polices always take precedence.
