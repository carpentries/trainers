# Trainers Meeting Guide

## 1. **Set the Schedule**

- **Responsibility**: The Instructor Trainers Leadership Committee (TLC).
- **Timing**: Schedule meetings well in advance, ideally annually.
- **Process**:
    1. Coordinate with the Core Team to avoid conflicts with other events.
    2. Set two meeting times to accommodate global time zones. Times are currently UTC 14:00 and UTC 23:00, on the first and third Thursday of the month. 
	    1. Changes to these times and dates should be based on unanimous consensus of the active Instructor Trainer community.
    3. Announce schedules and ensure they are added to the community calendars. Remind Instructor Trainers every October 1 about re-importing calendar items to accommodate daylight savings changes.

## 2. **Call for Topics**

- **Responsibility**: Instructor Trainer community members, facilitated by ITLC.
- **Process**:
    1. Announce a call for topics via community channels (e.g., Slack, mailing lists).
    2. Encourage members to propose topics in the [trainers etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/trainers) under the "Propose a Topic" section.
    3. Collect additional ideas from recent discussions, Slack threads, survey feedback, and [active issues](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/issues) in instructor training.
- **Tips**:
    - Highlight any specific themes or areas of focus for upcoming meetings.

## 3. **Set the Agenda**

- **Responsibility**: ITLC with input from the Instructor Trainer community.
- **Process**:
    1. Review proposed topics from the etherpad and prioritize them based on community interest and relevance.
    2. Confirm the agenda for each meeting, typically focusing on:
        - Pre/post-training discussions (for the first monthly meeting).
        - Community announcements.
        - A "topic of the month."
    3. Publish the finalized agenda on the etherpad and share highlights on community channels.
      
## 4. **Identify Meeting Lead(s)**

- **Responsibility**: ITLC or volunteer trainers.
- **Process**:
    1. Use the etherpad or GitHub to sign up volunteers to host meetings.
    2. If no one volunteers, the ITLC can reach out to the Instructor Trainer community.
    3. ITLC members will lead meetings for which no alternative host has volunteered.
- **Role of the Meeting Lead**:
    - Review the agenda and prepare to facilitate discussions.
    - Ensure the etherpad is set up with the meeting template.

## 5. **Hosting the Meeting**

- **Preparation**:
    - Confirm the Zoom link and update the etherpad with the meeting template.
    - Send a reminder email 2-3 days before the meeting (see email template).
- **During the Meeting**:
    1. Start on time and do introductions with an icebreaker.
    2. Do any pre/post-training discussions, followed by announcements and the topic of the month.
    4. Note attendance on the etherpad and ensure key discussion points are recorded.
- **After the Meeting**:
    1. Submit meeting notes and attendance to the [Trainers repo](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/tree/main/minutes).
    2. Add attendance to the Core Team's spreadsheet.

## 6. **Annual or Special Topics**

- Ensure at least one annual discussion to share updates on the Instructor Trainer program, as per committee guidelines.
- Facilitate special meetings for significant changes or decisions requiring Instrucor Trainer input.

## 7. **Additional Tips**

- **Community Input**: Regularly solicit feedback from Instructor Trainers about meeting structure and topics.
- **Inclusivity**: Ensure that meeting times and discussions are accessible and inclusive for all Instructor Trainers globally.
- **Documentation**: Keep a consistent record of all meetings to maintain transparency and support new Instructor Trainers.
